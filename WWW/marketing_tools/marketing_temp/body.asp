<P><I>AST Ovation! Marketing Templates</I> are designed to be customized
with your logo and company message. First, review the Marketing Templates
available and determine which one best suits your business. There is a Template
for each of AST's product lines, which is targeted to business end-users.
Each Template is pre-printed with a message that presents a hardware solution
using AST products. You determine your company message that will appear
on the Template. AST will print your custom message and logo on the direct
mail Template, and even handle the mailing.</P>

<P>If you want to maintain a relationship with your existing customers and
keep them apprised of your latest offerings, you can provide us with your
own mailing list. Or, if you want to expand your business and target new
customers, AST can provide a list of prospective end-users from an extensive
database of U.S. businesses. Web-based leads will be passed directly to
you via the Ovation! lead match system, and these prospects will be delivered
directly to your own home page. AST will match local businesses with the
key vertical markets you have identified in your Ovation! profile to provide
a highly targeted mailing. All you have to do is wait for them to start
coming in.</P>
