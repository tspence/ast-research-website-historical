<P>One of the best ways to obtain visibility, increase credibility, gather
qualified leads and make personal contact with customers is to exhibit at
trade shows. Through the AST Ovation! Program, Ovation! Gold Resellers participate
in regional trade show events with AST. The Trade Show Program includes
a complete package of materials and on-site support at the event, which
makes participation in trade shows easy.</P>

<P>AST will develop an event calendar each quarter. Ovation! Gold Resellers
will be contacted for participation by their regional sales representative.</P>

<P>The AST Ovation! Trade Show Program kit includes:</P>

<P>The Ovation! Trade Show Program kit is available at no cost to Ovation!
Gold Resellers. Ovation! Gold Resellers are required to pay a fully refundable
security deposit of $1,000 on the trade show booth.</P>

<P>The Ovation! Gold Reseller must complete the <A HREF="form.asp">online
trade show agreement form</A> including security deposit payment information.
Completed forms may be faxed to (714) 727-7630.</P>

<P>The Trade Show Program kit is subject to current availability. Requests
are completed on a first come, first served basis.</P>

<P>Trade show booths must be returned to AST complete and in good working
condition. The Ovation! Gold Reseller must contact AST within 72 from the
close of the show to arrange pick-up of the booth, or ship the booth back
to AST using show management shipping services.</P>

<P>If the trade show booth is returned to AST damaged beyond normal wear
and tear, the Ovation! Gold Reseller will be charged for all repairs. Payment
for repairs will be deducted from the deposit. The Ovation! Gold Reseller
will receive a statement of charges.</P>

<P>Once the trade show booth is received and in good working order, the
deposit will be returned to the reseller. Checks are issued within 15 days
of receipt of the trade show booth. For orders using FlexFunds or AST Allowance
funds, refunds will be issued as a credit to the FlexFunds or AST Allowance
account. The credit will be reflected on the following months statement.</P>

<P><B>Ordering Procedure</B></P>

<P>The Ovation! Gold Reseller must complete the <A HREF="form.asp">Online
Trade Show Agreement Form</A>. Forms and payment must be received at least
15 business days before the booth is needed. AST cannot guarantee delivery
in time for the show if the agreement is received less than 15 business
days before the show.</P>

<P>Ovation! Gold Resellers may use either FlexFunds, AST Allowance funds,
cashier's check or credit card (Visa, MasterCard or American Express) for
payment.</P>

<P>AST selects the carrier and method of shipment. Standard lead times apply.
In the case that the Ovation! Gold Reseller must use an alternate carrier,
the Ovation! Gold Reseller will be responsible for freight charges. AST
will ship the booth freight collect to the Ovation! Gold Reseller.</P>
