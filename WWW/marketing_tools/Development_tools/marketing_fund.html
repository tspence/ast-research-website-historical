Resellers enrolled in the AST Allowance program will be compensated at a
rate of 1% of their total net purchases of AST products. Purchases must
be made through an AST National Channel Account.</P>

<P>Use your funds to create the extraordinary ad campaigns, incredible direct
mailings or awesome sales promotions you've been wanting to do, but have
not had the funds to do so until now. AST will even provide free ad materials
such as line art and AST logo sheets.</P>
