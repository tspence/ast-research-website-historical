<P>IRVINE, Calif., December 17, 1997 – In an age when product lifecycles are shorter than the time traditionally used to disseminate updated technical information on new products to the professionals who service them, AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer Authorized Service Centers and other technical support professionals now have current AST product data at their fingertips via the company’s new extranet.</P>
<P>&#9;AST’s complete technical product reference library, named Pronto! Pro<SUP>&trade;</SUP>, includes whole-system and board photographs with location designators, chassis drawings, bios information, technical bulletins, product configuration information, and field-replaceable unit (FRU) part numbers -- by system.  Pronto! Pro has been available in a CD version for more than two years, and now is accessible online (www.ast.com/pronto) by the company’s authorized </P>
<P>service centers at no charge, and in the future, by other support professionals – including resellers and corporations – via a subscription.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;AST customers will benefit from less down time in the event a product fails,&quot; said Tom Scott, senior vice president, worldwide sales and marketing.  &quot;AST’s Authorized Service Centers are given an opportunity to increase their business through more efficient information acquisition and management.&quot;</P>
<P>A bi-monthly CD version, which also contains user’s and hardware maintenance manuals, will remain available to customers without Internet access or those who prefer the CD version.  AST plans to have the manuals available on the Web version later this month.</P>
<P>&#9;AST has assembled a worldwide virtual Pronto! Pro team, which is responsible for, and capable of, updating product data online immediately once it has changed from anywhere in the world.  Advanced information technologies combined with the real-time nature of the World Wide Web makes it possible to have that data available to authorized organizations and individuals quickly and seamlessly – the information on Pronto! Pro is designed not to be outdated.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;No longer will support professionals around the world wonder if the product data they have is current and accurate,&quot; Scott added.  &quot;Answers to AST product questions will always be available as fast as they can access Pronto! Pro online.  This intelligent and intuitive resource will result in an entirely more effective service and support system, benefiting organizations across the board, from AST as the manufacturer, to its service organizations and resellers, and ultimately, its customers.&quot;</P>

<P>Reseller Competitive Edge</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;Pronto! Pro online augments AST’s Ovation! reseller program, which offers greater support to companies who sell AST Premium<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>&reg;</SUP></FONT> Servers, Bravo commercial desktops, and Ascentia<SUP><FONT SIZE=3>&trade;</SUP></FONT> M notebook computers.  Ovation! provides tools and incentives designed to help resellers reduce their overall costs of doing business competitively and make it easier – and more profitable – for them to do business with AST.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;AST is committed to its resellers and the businesses they serve,&quot; Scott said.  &quot;By making their jobs easier and working to afford them a greater opportunity to succeed, AST, in turn, will succeed.  And that is what Pronto! Pro and Ovation! are all about.&quot;  </P>
