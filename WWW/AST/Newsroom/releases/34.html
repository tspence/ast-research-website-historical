<P><CENTER><B>AST Research Helps Complete Computer Data Network <BR>
Between California&#146;s Community &amp; State Colleges</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 9, 1997</I> &#150; AST<FONT FACE="Symbol">&Ograve;</FONT>
Research Inc. today helped further the Information Superhighway links between
California&#146;s community and state college systems by donating 20 server
PC systems to the Chancellor&#146;s Office of the California Community Colleges.</P>

<P>The 20 powerful AST Manhattan<FONT FACE="Symbol">&Ograve;</FONT> server
systems are expected to play a vital role in the California Community Colleges&#146;
massive technology initiative, connecting its data network of 107 community
colleges with the 23 campuses of the California State University system.</P>

<P>The server PCs were presented by Scott Bower, AST senior vice president,
Americas sales and marketing, at a meeting of the Board of Governors of
the California Community Colleges held at Coast Community College&#146;s
Garden Grove, Calif. campus.</P>

<P>&quot;We are investing in our state&#146;s future by helping to enhance
learning through networking and communication,&quot; said Mr. Bower. &quot;AST
believes strongly in supporting higher education. As such, we expect these
systems will enable students at many of California&#146;s colleges to have
access to vital computer resources.&quot;</P>

<P>The donation resulted from collaboration between Dr. Larry Toy, director
of human resource development and system advancement for the Chancellor&#146;s
office; Joyce Arntson, faculty member, Irvine Valley College; and Dennis
Holden, AST director of sales, Southwest region.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&quot;This generous donation from AST will greatly assist our continuing
efforts to infuse technology systemwide,&quot; said Thomas J. Nussbaum,
chancellor, California Community Colleges. &quot;We are developing major
initiatives to provide computer linkages that include new courseware and
on-line directories. With AST&#146;s contribution, we will be able to enhance
our capacity for these applications to help assure student success into
the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.&quot;</P>

<P>Student impact throughout the state from AST&#146;s donation is expected
to be significant, with a minimum of 44 on-line courses expected to be launched
at both community and state colleges during the current academic year. Once
up and running, students will be able to take these courses at the time
and place of their choice, thereby adding valuable flexibility to the class
schedules of many students.</P>
