IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 24, 1996 -- Debuting the latest addition
to the Advantage! fall consumer PC line-up, AST Computer (NASDAQ:
ASTA) today announced the availability of its Advantage! 9312
Communications PC.  One of the first PC manufacturers to bundle
a complete communications solution using Intel's Video Phone and
Intercast technology, the Advantage! 9312 includes an analog camera,
giving users a whole new gamut of video, audio and data communications
experiences.  These tools allow users to see and hear family and
friends up-close and personal, experience the rich programming
of TV and explore the exciting world of the Internet.  The Advantage!
9312 is competitively priced at $2,599.
<P>
&quot;The combination of the Intel Intercast technology and the
Intel Video Phone on the AST Advantage! PC is an example of how
the convergence of Internet, video and TV broadcast data is providing
the home user with a whole new spectrum of multimedia experiences,&quot;
said Lorie Wigle, Consumer Client Marketing Director, Intel Internet
and Communications Group.
<P>
Market research indicates that more than three million home computers
will be outfitted with video technology by 1998, a significant
increase from the 1.75 million estimate predicted for 1997, according
to Telespan Publishing Corp., of Altadena, Calif.  This prediction
supports the trend that video communications is one of the largest
growth segments within the consumer PC market.
<P>
&quot;The Advantage! line-up demonstrates how AST has delivered
a solutions-oriented approach for the consumer and our 'visual
society' by supporting the trend toward customized systems for
a diverse set of consumer interests and lifestyles,&quot; explained
Terry Baker, director of marketing for AST's worldwide consumer
products.  &quot;By integrating video and communications capabilities
into one system, the Advantage! 9312 makes face-to-face interaction
with family, friends and associates as easy as talking on the
phone.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Packed With Leading-Edge Technologies</B></U>
<BR>
The Advantage! 9312 Communications PC is equipped with a powerful
Intel 166MHz Pentium&#174; processor, large 2.5GB hard drive and 24MB
RAM to provide the speed, performance and processing power that
communications users expect.  Among the first-to-market hardware
and software enhancements included are:
<P>
<I><B>Intel Video Phone</B></I>:  With Intel Video Phone technology
and the bundled analog color video camera, the Advantage! 9312
PC enables far away family members to share special occasions
face-to-face, making celebrations even more meaningful.  In addition,
Video Phone can capture a high resolution snapshot of the person
to whom you are talking during the video call, which can then
be stored for future reference.  AST's Video Phone bundle not
only receives video conferenced information but allows the consumer
to send information as well.
<P>
<I><B>Intel Intercast</B></I> <I><B>Technology</B></I>:  Communications
savvy users will also appreciate Intel Intercast technology, which
combines the power of the PC, topical broadcast from television
and information from the Internet.  Intercast technology allows
for the simultaneous display of HTML-formatted information and
television broadcasts utilizing the Intercast TV/cable signal
available through a local cable provider. This feature allows
users watching CNN, for 
example, to download information on the topic that is being broadcast,
either to be reviewed immediately or to save and read later.
<P>
<I> <B>Analog Color Camera:</B></I>  Bundled as a standard feature
with the Advantage! 9312 is a color analog camera which completes
the Intel Communications Solution.  The camera has a low profile
advanced style and can be located on top of the monitor, giving
a 64 degree angle of view.  It features flicker fee operation
under 50Hz and 60Hz fluorescent lighting, giving the consumer
a clear picture of the person they are speaking with during a
video phone conversation. 
<P>
<I><B>Infrared Remote Control and Receiver</B>:</I>  Ease-of-use
is an important feature to consumers and AST addresses that need
by providing remote control access on the Advantage! 9312.  With
the touch of a button, consumers can remotely change the television
channel, increase the volume of their speakers or access their
CD-ROM drive, all from the comfort of their chair.
<P>
<I><B>Digital Simultaneous Voice Data (DSVD) 28.8 Modem</B></I>:
The DSVD modem features 28.8 kbps transmission speed to provide
digitally produced voice data for fast, real-time communications
and information sharing by multiple users. For example, a parent
working at the office can help a child at home edit a term paper
via their PC while simultaneously speaking to each other.
<P>
