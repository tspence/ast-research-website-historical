<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 17, 1997 – To further strengthen its support of resellers, AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer has revamped its Ovation! reseller program to offer greater support to companies who sell AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Servers, Bravo commercial desktops, and Ascentia</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&trade;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> M notebook computers.  The program provides tools and incentives designed to help resellers reduce their overall costs of doing business and make it easier – and more profitable – for them to do business with AST.</P>
<P>&#9;AST’s Ovation! now offers three tiers of membership – Gold, Silver, and Bronze – providing additional benefits to resellers who sell the most AST product.  Authorized resellers with an annual AST sales volume of $2,000,000 or higher qualify for Gold, $100,000 to $2,000,000 are Silver, and less than $100,000 are Bronze.  AST will have informational displays on the new Ovation! program in its COMDEX booth – #L1248/L1647.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;AST redesigned its Ovation! program to provide greater overall support to resellers as well as to better reward those resellers who are committed to selling AST products,&quot; explained Tom Scott, AST’s senior vice president, Worldwide Sales &amp; Marketing.  &quot;This reaffirms AST’s commitment to the channel.  We are increasing our support at a time when other vendors appear to be scaling back.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;The Ovation! program also offers a number of new benefits for participants.  For example, in addition to enhancements of existing elements, the Gold level of the program now includes evaluation units, free tech training, and a dedicated sales representative to those who qualify.</P>

<P>&#9;The types of support available to Ovation! Gold participants include qualified leads provided electronically, free 60-day evaluation units that can be purchased at a significant discount, a salesforce automation program that offers significant discounts on AST notebooks, customizable direct mail templates, a trade show support program, and a variety of sales incentive programs.  Qualifying participants also receive individual sales support and advanced training programs, including individual business skills consulting seminars.  In addition, all Ovation! participants have access to AST’s reseller site, where many of these valuable tools and information are available online.</P>
<P>&#9;Ovation! resellers can generate additional income through other AST programs, such as AST Financial Services, which offers a  comprehensive customized leasing program, and AST’s PC Trade-In Program, which helps generate sales by encouraging end-users to upgrade obsolete hardware.  AST’s extended warranty programs -- including Guardian Care<SUP>SM</SUP> four-hour on-site response for servers and desktops as well as ExeCare Plus 48-hour notebook repair and ExpressOne</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&trade;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> 24-hour notebook replacement -- provide additional revenue sources for resellers qualifying as AST Authorized Service Centers.</P>
