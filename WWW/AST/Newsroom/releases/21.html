<B>AST RESEARCH ANNOUNCES FINAL APPROVALS OBTAINED<BR>
FOR THE SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS MERGER</B><BR>
</center>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., August 4, 1997 &#150; AST Research Inc. &#40;ASTA&#150;NASDAQ&#41; today announced that all necessary approvals have been received for completion of the merger planned in an agreement between the company and Samsung Electronics.  The company expects the merger between Samsung and AST to be completed on or about Aug. 25.<BR>
<P>
AST's announcement accompanies today's statement from Samsung Electronics that it has received approval from the Korean government regarding the proposal to purchase  all of the outstanding shares of AST stock that Samsung does not already own at a price of &#36;5.40 per share.  All other government approvals have been obtained.<BR>
<P>
&#34;Approval by the Korean government clears the way for AST to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung Electronics,&#34; said S.T. Kim, president and chief executive officer.  &#34;As a Samsung company, AST's position in the market is strengthened and is another indication as to the long-term intent on building and promoting the AST brand name.&#34;<BR>
<P>
With the receipt of all government approvals, remaining activities to be implemented for the merger between Samsung and AST to be completed include the expiration of the tender offer on Aug. 8 and cash payments issued to shareholders who have tendered their shares.  Shareholders of record who have not tendered their shares by Aug. 8 will promptly be sent instructions on how they may receive cash payments by submitting their shares of AST stock.<BR>
<P>
In early September, record holders of Liquid Yield Option Notes &#40;LYONs&#41; issued by AST will be sent instructions specifying how they may redeem their notes for cash.  The company expects LYONs to be redeemable on or about Oct. 1, 1997.<BR>
<P>
As previously announced, the tender offer and withdrawal rights regarding Samsung's purchase of AST common shares will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Friday, August 8, 1997.  AST and Samsung do not expect that this date will be further extended.  Samsung was informed by the Depositary that 27,799,572 shares &#40;approximately 88&#37; of the outstanding shares not owned by Samsung&#41; had been tendered as of July 21, 1997.<BR>
