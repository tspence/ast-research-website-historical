<CENTER><B>AST RESEARCH NAMES Y.S. KIM NEW CEO AND PRESIDENT</B></CENTER>
<P>

IRVINE, Calif., August 27, 1996 -- The Board of Directors of AST Research, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTA) has appointed 
Young-Soo Kim as chief executive officer and president following the resignation of Ian Diery from both posts.  
Mr. Kim was formerly corporate vice president at Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., which holds a significant equity 
stake in AST.  Mr. Kim, who was one of the primary engineers of Samsung's initial 1995 investment in AST, has more 
than 25 years of experience in the U.S. computer and electronics industries in executive positions at companies 
including IBM and Honeywell in addition to Samsung.  Mr. Kim has relinquished his post at Samsung to accept the 
new positions at AST.
<P>
The change in the top position was amicably agreed upon with Mr. Diery who is leaving to pursue other interests.
<P>
&#34;We continue to believe in the future of AST as a truly global force in multimedia technology, and we believe strongly 
that Y.S. Kim can make that vision a reality,&#34; said Kwang-Ho Kim (no relation), chairman of the board of AST and vice 
chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics.  &#34;This action demonstrates Samsung's commitment to making AST strong.&#34;
<P>
Mr. Y.S. Kim, who has served as a director of AST since July 1995, 
sees substantial but unrealized potential for AST.  &#34;Progress has been made at AST in many areas during the past year,&#34; 
Mr. Kim said.  &#34;But substantial further progress must be made to address the considerable challenges facing the company 
and to return AST to a level where it can achieve sustained growth.&#34;
<P>
He added that AST's relationship with Samsung must be more fully 
utilized in order for AST to achieve its full potential.  &#34;AST can benefit greatly not only from Samsung's financial support 
but from the expertise gained from years of success in developing and marketing innovative technology products.&#34;
<P>
Another top priority for AST, Mr. Kim said, is to continue to strengthen the process of becoming more responsive to 
customers at all levels of the organization.  &#34;AST's product development, marketing and service activities must begin 
and end with a keen understanding of what our customers truly want and need.  To achieve that goal, we will increase 
investment in training our service representatives and empower our employees to have greater responsibility for 
customer satisfaction.&#34;
<P>
Mr. Kim has been corporate vice president of Samsung Electronics in Seoul, Korea since January 1993.  Prior to 1993, he 
held positions of increasing responsibility at Samsung, including vice president of the Semiconductor division and executive 
vice president of the Corporate Planning Office. He also created and was named president of Samsung's Computer & Systems 
division.
<P>
Prior to joining Samsung in 1987, Mr. Kim was vice president of the Solid State Electronics division of Honeywell, Inc., in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, beginning in 1974.  In 1969, he founded Semiconductor Electronics Memory, Inc., a manufacturer of 
IBM add-on memory systems, in Phoenix, Arizona.  From 1961 to 1969, Mr. Kim held the position of senior manager of Process 
Engineering at IBM in East Fishkill, New York.
<P>
Safi Qureshey, AST's co-founder who now serves as Chairman Emeritus 
and an AST Director, said, &#34;Since the very first days of Samsung's relationship with AST, I have found Y.S. Kim to be a 
person with a penetrating vision of the future of the international market for technology products, and a clear sense of 
how to move AST to the forefront of that market.  He is an excellent choice to move AST forward from this point.&#34;
