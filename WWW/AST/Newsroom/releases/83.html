&quot;Internet access is clearly one of the most important communications
issues facing companies today.  However, the Internet and Intranet are
relatively new concepts for many companies and people are often unsure about the
decisions that need to be made when connecting to the 'net,&quot; explained
Chris Norman, director of marketing for AST's Advanced Systems Group. &quot;By
teaming with an internationally recognized Internet service provider like
NETCOM, AST has removed the guesswork that often comes with the Internet
connectivity territory.  Their expertise and proven level of service was a
natural pairing with AST and the Manhattan Commerce PRO.&quot;
