<P>IRVINE, Calif., January 12, 1998 – The capabilities of today’s notebook computers have increased so rapidly in recent years that, for many companies, mobile solutions are replacing desktops as a method of increasing worker productivity through performance and versatile portability. To provide commercial end-users with the highest performing portable computers, AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer’s Ascentia<FONT FACE="Symbol">&Ocirc;</FONT> notebook line is now utilizing Intel Corporation’s fastest processor for the mobile market to date, the 266MHz mobile Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> processor with MMX<FONT FACE="Symbol">&Ocirc;</FONT> technology.</P>
<P>&#9;"AST customers rely on the best performing machines available to maintain the highest level of productivity," Tom Scott, AST senior vice president, worldwide sales and marketing, said. "The performance of Intel’s latest mobile Pentium processor with MMX technology is enabling Ascentia users to take full advantage of the advanced features AST has incorporated into its mobile systems virtually anywhere they wish to work."</P>
<P>&#9;AST’s newest Ascentia notebook, which will debut in the first quarter of 1998, will leverage the new processor’s desktop-level performance to optimize its extensive network manageability, security, and portability capabilities, providing work forces with a versatile mobile solution that performs at the office or in the field.</P>
<P>While in the office, these features provide IS managers with more tools to integrate a mobile solution into their businesses’ computing systems – safely and without sacrificing performance. And on the road, Ascentia users won’t miss their old desktops by maintaining long periods of portable performance with Lithium Ion batteries, fast and convenient connections with 56K maximum speed PC-card modems and Laplink<SUP>&trade;</SUP> traveling software, and simple data synchronization with Puma TranXit<SUP>&trade;</SUP>.</P>
<P>"AST and Intel have a long-standing relationship, which breeds some of the highest performing PCs available and total computing solutions for AST’s customers," said Steve Nachtsheim, corporate vice president and general manager, Intel Mobile and Handheld Products Group. "In addition to the efficient power consumption of Intel’s 266MHz mobile Pentium processor with MMX technology, the new processor will help AST customers fully utilize Ascentia’s advanced mobile computing capabilities."</P>

<P>&#9;The second-generation Ascentia M will offer IS professionals greater network control with Intel LANDesk<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 3.1, DMI compliancy with DMI 2.0 agent, WFM compliancy, and S.M.A.R.T. hard drives.
