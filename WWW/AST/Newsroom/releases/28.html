<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman">IRVINE, Calif., August 11, 1997 -<B> AST Research
Inc.</B> today announced that it has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
<B><A HREF="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung Electronics, Co. Ltd.</A></B>
as a result of the completion today of the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Samsung with and into AST. <BR>
	The merger was effected pursuant to the short-form merger provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law and follows the successful completion
on Friday, August 8, 1997 of Samsung's tender offer for all of the shares
of AST not owned by Samsung for $5.40.<BR>
	Samsung announced that 28,537,986 shares were tendered, representing approximately
90 percent of the outstanding shares not owned by Samsung.  In the merger,
each share of AST's common stock not tendered (other than shares as to which
appraisal rights are exercised) was converted into the right to receive
$5.40 in cash.  Shortly, materials will be mailed to AST stockholders whose
shares were not tendered, if their names and addresses were in AST's stock
records, along with a letter of transmittal which will provide instructions
to receive the $5.40 per share.<BR>
	The company also announced it is no longer a publicly-owned company and
its common stock and Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYON) are no longer registered.
 AST has filed a request with NASDAQ to be discontinued from the exchange's
listing of publicly traded companies (formally listed as ASTA).<BR>
 	With the completion of the merger, AST will begin the process of offering
to purchase all of the LYONs.  AST plans to soon begin mailing notification
to LYON holders of record specifying how they may redeem their notes for
cash.  The company expects LYONs to be redeemable on or about Oct. 1, 1997.
