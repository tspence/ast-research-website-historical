<P>IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 22, 1997 -- In a move that signifies its commitment to delivering comprehensive hardware and software solutions to its customers, AST<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>&reg;</SUP></FONT> Computer is simultaneously introducing three new products for the first time in company history. Following AST’s recent acquisition by powerhouse Samsung Electronics, this tri-product introduction showcases the synergy between the two companies as well as AST’s aggressive commitment to providing total computing solutions for today’s business users.</P>
<P>"In the past, we have simply focused on one product at a time," explained Laura Raybin, AST’s director, brand marketing. "Now we are focused on providing total solutions for the business market. Whether they are looking for a new notebook, desktop or server, AST has the products and service that companies need to help them focus on running their business, not their computers."</P>
<P>AST is committed to becoming the most responsive manufacturer in the industry, and it has dedicated itself to meeting the needs of the business user, especially small- to medium-sized companies often overlooked by the competition. In developing these new computers, AST listened to the needs of business users and took advantage of synergies with Samsung to deliver state-of-the-art systems with performance and features that set them apart from the competition.</P>
<B><U><P>A Machine for All Seasons</P>
</B></U><P>AST’s new products address the needs of today’s business users, such as security for notebooks, reliability for servers and ease-of-use for desktops. The tri-product launch includes:</P>

<UL>
<B><I><LI>AST Premium&trade; HS Server</B></I> -- Offering maximum redundancy and maintainability in a mid-range product, the new AST Premium HS server minimizes the risk of data loss and downtime while reducing overall cost of ownership. Available in late October, the application server features dual Intel<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> II ECC processors and 440LX core logic AGPset for high-speed processing and optimal performance in demanding operations.</LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>The new Premium HS server offers standard configurations loaded with features that most vendors charge extra for, such as three redundant hot-swap power supplies, an integrated Ultra Wide SCSI three-channel RAID controller, and other soon-to-be-announced technologies designed to increase LAN throughput and processor performance.</P>
<P>AST’s revolutionary FlexChassis allows for easy access to the server’s key components so maintenance and upgrades are easier and downtime is reduced. In addition to a standard three-year limited warranty that includes next business day on-site response, the company’s Guardian Care<SUP>SM</SUP> Program provides a four-hour on-site response option to ensure rapid service and minimize downtime.</P></DIR>


<UL>
<B><I><LI>Ascentia&trade; M Notebooks</B></I> -- One of the downsides to mobile computing is theft, and that can be a real problem for companies because business data is often just as valuable as the actual hardware. AST has responded by introducing the Ascentia M series of notebook computers which offer an arsenal of data and system security solutions. This includes a removable hard drive and various antivirus and other performance enhancing software as well as innovative options such as a stealth agent tracking device and an automatic data back-up via the Internet.</LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>Featuring the power and efficiency of Intel’s newest mobile Pentium processors with MMX&trade; technology, the Ascentia M series can handle today’s most demanding mobile applications. Common docking and AST’s ExpressONE&trade; Overnight Notebook Exchange program, which will deliver a replacement notebook within 24 hours anywhere in the contiguous U.S., help distinguish the Ascentia M from the competition. Six new models are currently available to meet individual customer requirements.</P></DIR>


<UL>
<B><I><LI>Bravo MS Desktops</B></I> -- AST knows that its customers would rather focus on running their business, rather than their PCs. That is why the company made the new additions to the Bravo MS line -- 6266 and 6300 -- easy to use and maintain. The high-performance commercial desktops feature the latest technology -- Intel’s new Pentium II processor and 440LX</LI></UL>

<P>AGPset -- to handle today’s most demanding business applications.</P><DIR>

<P>The desktops also include AST’s System Noise Reduction (SNR) which makes them significantly quieter than standard business PCs, reducing "white noise pollution" in the workplace and contributing to a better overall office environment.</P>
<P>Currently available, the new systems feature AST’s FlexChassis, based on Intel’s new NLX standard. This enables components such as hard drives, floppy drives, RAM, CPU, CD-ROM and video RAM to be easily accessed and removed -- with the push of a button -- dramatically reducing the time it takes to upgrade and service systems. Combined with AST’s aggressive service and support programs, this feature makes the new Bravo MS systems among the industry’s easiest and most cost effective to maintain.</P></DIR>
