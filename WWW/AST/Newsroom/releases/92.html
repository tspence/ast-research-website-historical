IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 20, 1996 -- AST Computer today delivered
another home run by being the first PC manufacturer to introduce
to the indirect channel a 6X CD-ROM with three-CD minichangers
for its home and home office users.
<P>
Shipping on AST's new line of Intel Pentium&reg; processor-based Advantage!
PCs, the 6X CD-ROM drives use designated SmartCD Manager&#153; software, from
Smart Storage, located in Andover, Mass.  Smart Storage is a recognized
market leader in network-based CD-Recordable (CD-R) management
software.
<P>
&quot;AST has partnered with Smart Storage because of its strong
reputation and demonstrated expertise with CD jukebox management
software.  Users now have an added degree of flexibility in running
and managing collections of CD-ROMS and audio CDs,&quot; said
AST's Dan Sheppard, director of desktop marketing.
<P>
AST's Advantage! systems incorporate minichangers provided by
Tottori Sanyo Electric Company, located in Tottori City, Japan,
on which the management software from Smart Storage is bundled.
<P>
&quot;The combination of AST's technical innovation with the
market leader in network-based CD-Recordable (CD-R) management software 
provides one of the most robust combinations of power and performance 
surpassing the technology dreams of today's consumer,&quot; stated Peter 
Smails, vice president of product marketing, of Smart Storage.
<P>
AST believes that the combination of a powerful minichanger from
a well-respected company like Sanyo with the software management
expertise of Smart Storage enables users to access collections
of CD-ROMS on their desktop in a timely and efficient manner.
<P>
&quot;It makes perfect sense for the consumer to upgrade a basic
CD-ROM drive to a minichanger,&quot; said Sheppard.
<P>
&quot;We expect that minichangers will become just as prevalent
in the home computer market as multi-CD players are in the audio
market over the next twelve months,&quot; he added.

<U><B>Key Benefits</B></U><BR>
SmartCD Manager allows users to:
<UL>
<LI>Catalog collections of reference, audio, multimedia and photo
CDs for easy identification with descriptive information for each
disc.
<LI>Easily inventory, select, load and run individual CDs with
a user-friendly icon and menu driven interface.
<LI>Access all three CDs by a single drive letter, instead of
a drive letter for each disc, allowing the CDs to be removed and
inserted in different slots inside the changer without affecting
playback or program operation.
</UL>
<P>
<U><B>Chauffeur and Driver All In One</B></U><BR>
SmartCD Manager represents a significant improvement over existing
device drivers by integrating a graphical database, changer device
management capabilities and a launch pad for CD-based applications
into a single environment.  According to Smart Storage, it is
the first product of its kind to provide simple, functional tools
to access up to three discs on the AST CD changer.
<P>
<U><B> High Growth Market</B></U><BR>
According to Freeman and Associates Inc., a high tech market
research firm in northern California, the CD is quickly becoming
the data management and storage solution of choice among consumers.
For worldwide shipments from all suppliers during 1994, the survey
reveals that shipments of CD-ROM drives were up 148 percent over
1993 levels, with revenue up 95 percent.
<P>
&quot;CD-ROM is a key enabling technology for multimedia and
mass storage because CD technology is uniquely qualified to handle
all types of digital data including text, audio and motion video,&quot;
noted Sheppard.
<P>
<U><B>An Advantage! PC For All Seasons</B></U><BR>
