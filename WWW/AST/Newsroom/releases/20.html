IRVINE, Calif., May 27, 1997 - Striking a strategic blow against

software packages provide Bravo users with powerful armor against
more than 11,000 different computer viruses at all points of entry.

&quot;Bravo corporate customers depend on AST to provide computing
solutions that boost office productivity and offer outstanding
reliability,&quot; stated Laura Raybin, director, brand marketing,

With a virus detection rate of 98 percent proven in several independent
studies, McAfee VirusScan finds and removes nearly every virus
that a Bravo PC user might encounter.  It provides unparalleled
protection against Microsoft&reg; Word and Excel macros, boot
sector infectors, file infectors, encrypted viruses, multi-partite
viruses, polymorphic viruses and new viruses written in Microsoft
Visual Basic&reg;. With a worldwide unit marketshare of 52 percent,
McAfee VirusScan is the world's most popular anti-virus software,
selling more units that all other packages combined.

&quot;We applaud AST for taking proactive and decisive steps to
protect their Bravo customers from viruses,&quot; said Peter Watkins,
vice president and general manager, Security Products Division,
McAfee.  &quot;By bundling McAfee's anti-virus protection with

attachments before they are opened.  WebScan easily integrates
with all major browsers including Netscape Navigator, Internet
Explorer, Mosaic and NetCruiser.  Offering secure protection to
Bravo customers, WebScan allows users to safely download files,
send and receive e-mail and surf more than 100,000 Web sites on-line.
