<P>IRVINE, Calif., June 17, 1997 – In its continuing commitment to respond to customers' needs for lowering total cost of ownership, AST<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>&reg;</SUP></FONT> Computer announced its support of Intel's Wired for Management (WfM) Baseline Specification which is intended to help make the management of PCs and network resources simple and cost-effective.   AST's implementation of the specification will lead to better value for its customers by decreasing the total cost of business computing while taking advantage of the power and flexibility offered by its industry leading PCs. </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Today marks the start of a renewed commitment to our valued customers.  We are responding to what our business users want – powerful and flexible computing solutions, leading technologies, easy network administration, price competitive products and low cost of ownership,&quot; stated AST's Dan Sheppard, vice president, marketing.  &quot;Our adoption of the Wired for Management program is a ringing endorsement of our unwavering commitment to provide our customers with the best value proposition and reduced total cost of ownership.&quot; </P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>The first release of Intel's Wired for Management Baseline focused on desktop PCs and mobile systems in an early June release.  Guidance on server systems will be added to the WfM Baseline at the end of June.  The specification is a key element of Intel's Wired for Management initiative, with the next release expanding the specification to include mobile and server systems.</P>
<P>&quot;By using the Wired for Management Baseline Specification as a reference for PC management capabilities, AST will give its customers valuable tools to help cut PC support costs,&quot; said Mike Aymar, vice president and general manager of Intel's Desktop Product Group.  &quot;This will help further the goals of the Wired for Management initiative in making business PCs easier to manage without sacrificing performance or compatibility.&quot;</P>
<P>The WfM Baseline Specification is designed to help PC manufacturers produce systems that can be easily and effectively managed over corporate networks and reduce customer support costs.  Systems based on the Wired for Management Baseline Specification will feature software agents and other capabilities that enhance network operation and reduce support costs, while taking advantage of the PC's flexibility, performance and compatibility with existing networks.</P>
<P>The Wired for Management Baseline addresses key factors that contribute to lower Total Cost of Ownership:</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>Ease of use challenges: </B> As PC user numbers rise, the need to provide continuing support for novice users increases and becomes more challenging.</LI>
<B><LI>Growing demands for system availability:</B>  With PC networks becoming much more reliant, the need to maintain high availability becomes paramount.  Downtime often occurs because IT personnel lack needed information on configurations, bandwidth and usage patterns. </LI>
<B><LI>Time-consuming repairs: </B> Support personnel often lack the tools for remote diagnostics so onsite repairs tend to be time consuming and costly.  Repairs can be slow and labor intensive.</LI>
<B><LI>Difficulties of asset management: </B> Asset management is notoriously difficult for many organizations to implement and the process of analyzing investment tends to be a manual one. There is a need to provide organizations with information on inventory and configuration data, leasing considerations, analyzing effectiveness of costs of training, software upgrade analysis for volume purchasing, efficiency of outsourcing, current usage improvements and effective management of new technologies.</LI></UL>

<P>&#9;AST plans to begin implementing the WfM Baseline Specification from Intel in its award-winning desktop and notebook products later this summer, debuting with its Bravo MS series of commercial desktops.</P>
<P>&#9;The solution to many of the problems faced by IT management addressed by Intel's Wired for Management initiative is to make PCs universally manageable and universally managed.  The intelligence inherent in a PC allows it to play a role in the management process and makes it easier for IT organizations to automate and centralize management activities.  There have been two fundamental barriers preventing PCs in the past from being fully managed:  1) there has been no common set of management features that are guaranteed to be found on all PCs, and 2) manageability features have not adhered to industry standards.</P>
<P>&#9;The Wired for Management Baseline Specification aims to address these shortcomings by describing a targeted minimum set of management features on all PC platforms.  These features are made available through well-defined, industry-standard specifications.  This will give management applications a consistent method to access those features, ultimately making it easier to administer the network and consequently reducing the total cost of ownership.</P>
