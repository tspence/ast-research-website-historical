<P>LAS VEGAS, November 14, 1997 – AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are urging the hundreds of thousands of Comdex trade show attendees traveling to Las Vegas November 17-24 to take preventative measures to reduce the risks of portable computer theft and to protect their valuable data on their portable machines. </P>
<P>&#9;Based on industry statistics, potentially hundreds of portable computers will be stolen or lost during the week of Comdex, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars – or more -- in equipment and valuable data lost. MSNBC reported in July 1997 that 265,000 portable computers were stolen in 1996. According to Safeware, an insurer of personal computers, $1.4 billion in notebook PCs were stolen that year, representing a 28 percent increase from 1995. And the FBI reports that 90 percent of stolen computer equipment is never recovered.</P>
<P>"Considering the nature of Comdex, we expect a much higher than average proportion of Las Vegas visitors that week will be carrying portable computers," said Sergeant Shane Robb with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s Tourist Safety Unit. "When the expected 230,000 show attendees converge on the city, it will be a thief’s dream-come-true. The best defense is to arm yourself with knowledge and tools. And most of all, don’t let your notebook out of your sight!" </P>

<B><U><P>Education is the Key to Security<BR>
</B></U>&#9;"AST is taking the initiative to educate the computing world about the significance of portable computer theft and that intelligent solutions are being developed to combat the problem," explained Laura Raybin, AST’s director, brand marketing. "Only recently, with the steady increase in notebook sales, has there been a concerted effort by the industry to protect mobile users against the potentially devastating loss of valuable data on a notebook computer. Security represents another growth opportunity for the industry, and education is the key."</P>
<P>Supported by the LVMPD, AST offers ten tips for travelers toting portable computers, based on information AST compiled when designing a comprehensive security solution into its Ascentia<SUP><FONT SIZE=4>&trade;</SUP></FONT> M notebook series.</P>
