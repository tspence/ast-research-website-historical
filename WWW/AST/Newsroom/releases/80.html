IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 16, 1996 - Leading the migration towards
Windows NT and Pentium&#174; Pro technology, AST Computer announced
today that its employees have become &quot;PowerPro&quot; certified.
Through the Certification Program, AST has taken the unusual
step of training and certifying all AST employees, both technical
and non-technical, on the benefits of Windows NT and Pentium Pro
technology.  This training program demonstrates AST's recognition
of the corporate community's move towards 32-bit computing environments.
<P>
&quot;AST is proud to be implementing a far-reaching training
program that expands our employees' understanding of these new
technologies,&quot; said Laura Raybin, AST's director of worldwide
product marketing for commercial desktops.  &quot;The market is
on the brink of a new wave of computing and we see this training
as a way to plan for the future.  The education of our employees
proves that we have a strong understanding of the 32-bit environment
and can anticipate the needs of the business community.&quot;
<P>

<BR>
Earlier this month, AST employees attended interactive training
sessions to certify them in the Windows NT and Pentium Pro environments.
These training sessions enabled AST employees to &quot;talk the
talk&quot; of Pentium Pro and Windows NT power users.  During
these sessions, they learned the inner workings of the 32-bit
environment and why this direction is so important to all AST
employees, as well as the business community at large.  
<P>
More than 2,700 AST employees in this nationwide training program
received a combination of technical training and industry overviews,
enabling them to better understand the operating system and its
place in the market.  With a Pentium Pro and Windows NT education
under their belts, AST employees have the expertise to effectively
offer the right solutions.  The company encourages all potential
PowerPro users to access AST as a first-source for 32-bit computing
information.

<U><B>AST Goes the Extra Mile</B></U>
<BR>
For those customers who are unsure if they are ready to move
towards 32-bit computing applications, AST has developed additional
programs to smoothly transition customers to this leading-edge
technology.  AST's Test Drive Program allows qualifying prospective
customers to evaluate Bravo MS-T Pro Series systems at their own
pace.  This innovative program works to better familiarize customers
with Windows NT 4.0 and Pentium Pro processor capabilities.  The
Test Drive Program runs concurrently with Intel's Seed Unit Program,
of which AST is an active participant.  The Seed Unit Program
is another means for large corporations to test Pentium Pro technology
within their own computing environment.
<P>
<U><B>Meeting Today's Needs and Tomorrow's Challenges</B></U>
<BR>
&quot;AST has noticed a dramatic growth among Pentium Pro users
migrating to the Windows NT Workstation platform,&quot; Raybin
explained.  &quot;End-users and resellers alike have questions
about 32-bit environments, how to implement them, what features
they need and what benefits to expect.  With our unprecedented
training and by providing the required product features, corporate
users can feel confident that they have a business partner who
can meet today's requirements as well as tomorrow's challenges.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>AST Unlocks the Power</B></U>
<BR>
AST is making the commitment towards 32-bit computing applications
both in product and programs.  AST now ships all Bravo MS-T Pro
6180 and 6200 Pentium Pro-based commercial desktop computers with
the Windows NT 4.0 operating system and the Intel&#174; EtherExpress&#153;
PRO/100B network-ready solution.  These systems are aggressively
priced with an estimated street price of $2,490 for the Bravo
6180 model and $3,036 for the Bravo 6200 model.
<P>
&quot;We are delighted that AST is pre-installing Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 on their Bravo MS-T Pro systems designed for large
organizations,&quot; said Pat Fox, group manager, Desktop and
Business Systems Division at Microsoft.  &quot;AST customers are
the real winners as they experience the flexibility, reliability
and performance of the Windows NT 32-bit architecture.&quot;
<P>
 Windows NT 4.0 provides the Bravo MS-T Pro series with the highest
level of system reliability and data protection for demanding
environments such as transaction processing, graphics handling
and other mission critical applications.  It is the only network
operating system that is multi-purpose, scales from the workgroup
across to the enterprise and has built-in Internet and Intranet
support.
<P>
The Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B networking card provides Bravo
MS-T Pro series users a network-ready solution designed specifically
for the Pentium Pro processor and the PCI bus.  It dramatically
improves total system performance and user productivity while
maximizing throughput over standard Ethernet or Fast Ethernet
networks.  The EtherExpress' high-performance architecture minimizes
CPU utilization by seamlessly migrating from 10Mbps to 
100Mbps.  This equips the Bravo MS-T Pro 6180 and 6200 systems
with even more computing power to meet even the most demanding
applications.
