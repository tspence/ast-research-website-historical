<B>AST RESEARCH ANNOUNCES MANAGEMENT CHANGES </B>
<P>
<B>New Senior-Level Position Created to Merge Global Marketing
and Communications</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., October 4, 1996 -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA--NASDAQ)
today announced a series of executive changes occurring this month
and its ongoing reorganization program designed to expedite the
company's return to profitability.
<P>
 Included among the changes are the resignations of Michael Willcocks,
47, senior vice president, Asia Pacific, and Gerald T. Devlin,
50, senior vice president, Americas.  Both corporate officers
have resigned to pursue other career opportunities.
<P>
 AST also announced it has created a new position of Senior Vice
President, Global Corporate Marketing and Communications, and
that the company has initiated a search to fill that position.
 The new position consolidates AST's strategic responsibilities
for global marketing and channel strategies, in addition to customer
relations, brand promotion and corporate communications.
<P>
 Integral to the new marketing and communications organization
is another newly-created position, Vice President, Global Corporate
Marketing, which will be responsible for global marketing activities
that include customer research, regional strategy development
and brand promotion across all product families.  This new position
will report to the senior vice president, Global Corporate Marketing
and Communications.
<P>
 The company also has consolidated product concept and life cycle
management for all desktop, mobile and server brand families under
the newly-formed Product Planning Group, which reports to N.B.
Park, senior vice president, worldwide product development and
manufacturing. &quot;Although stability is an important long-term
goal in our return to profitability, changes may inevitably occur,&quot;
said Y.S. Kim, AST president and chief executive officer.  &quot;We
have made rapid progress in a relatively brief period of time
towards bolstering our leadership capabilities in engineering,
manufacturing, quality, service and support and finance.  Our
strategy is to streamline the decision making process and empower
management to respond quickly to the fast-changing needs of the
technology marketplace.
<P>
 &quot;By creating the new global corporate marketing position
at the officer level and consolidating all marketing and communications
functions into one organization, AST will be better positioned
to establish and maintain a cohesive identity -- from product
inception, all the way through manufacturing, distribution, sales
and service.  This new approach will be supported by a fully unified
global mission that clearly expresses AST's values and delivers
on them quickly.&quot;
<P>
 Assuming responsibility for activities within the Asia Pacific
region will be Hoon Choo, 50, a member of the team of Samsung
consultants who are assisting AST in improving its operational
efficiencies.  He will join the company as senior vice president,
Asia Pacific.
<P>
 As senior vice president, manufacturing (consulting), Mr. Choo
helped significantly improve production efficiencies at AST's
Fort Worth manufacturing facility.  Mr. Choo founded A-Cube Systems
(Cupertino, Calif.) and held positions in the past as an executive
vice president of Hyundai Electronics America and as a director
of Samsung Electronics' Computer Division.
<P>
 Responsibilities for the Americas region will be filled on an
interim basis by Mr. Kim until a permanent replacement is appointed
for Mr. Devlin.
