<B>ROGER W. JOHNSON, FORMER WESTERN DIGITAL CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO
NAMED TO AST RESEARCH BOARD OF DIRECTORS</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., November 7, 1996 -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA --
NASDAQ) today announced Roger W. Johnson, past chairman, chief
executive officer and president at Western Digital Corp. and a
former top official for the U.S. General Services Administration
(GSA) within the Clinton Administration, was named to the company's
Board of Directors.
<P>
As president and CEO of Western Digital, Mr. Johnson, 62, led
efforts to establish the company as one of the premier manufacturers
of personal computer components and peripherals.  Joining Western
Digital in 1982 as president and chief operating officer, he also
was named a director in 1993 and shortly thereafter was appointed
CEO.  During his tenure, he helped grow the company from revenues
of approximately $30 million, to multi-billion, Fortune 500 status.
<P>
&quot;Roger is a perfect addition to our corporate governance
team,&quot; said Y.S. Kim, AST president and chief executive officer.
&quot;His successful administration, turnaround and reinvention
experience gained within the private and public sectors is a great
resource which we intend to utilize to the maximum extent in our
efforts to return to profitability.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Johnson, 62, served as GSA Administrator from 1993 to March
1996.  In June 1995, he was appointed by President Clinton to
the National Economic Council and also was a member of the President's
Management Council, responsible for ensuring implementation of
many federal reinvention initiatives championed by Vice President
Al Gore.
<P>
Created in 1949, the General Services Administration sets federal
policy in the areas of information technology, telecommunications
and automated data processing, supply and service procurement
and real property management and acquisition.  Mr. Johnson directed
all functions of the federal agency, which employs more than 16,000
and has financial responsibilities for more than $64 billion.
<P>
On the occasion of Mr. Johnson receiving an honorary doctorate
degree from Clarkson University, President Clinton said, &quot;Roger
has brought the skills he developed so well in the private sector
to his outstanding work at GSA, helping us to improve the way
our government works.  He has truly used his success to benefit
others and I thank him for a job well done.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I am very excited to help AST turn things around and plan
on taking an active role to assist where possible,&quot; said
Mr. Johnson.  &quot;The excellent relationships and working knowledge
of both AST and Samsung Electronics that have been developed over
the years create a unique vantage point as an outside director
that will enable me to provide counsel and guidance in a variety
of areas.&quot;
<P>
In addition to AST, Mr. Johnson serves as a member of the Board
of Directors for Elexys International Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.),
Group Technologies (Tampa, Fla.), Insulectro, (Lake Forest, Calif.),
and JTS Corp. (San Jose, Calif.).  He also has been appointed
a Regent Lecturer of the University of California, Irvine, where
he teaches a graduate course titled &quot;New Leadership Roles,&quot;
and with his wife Janice, is an active supporter of arts and philanthropic
organizations.
