<B>AST REPORTS SECOND QUARTER, TRANSITION PERIOD 1995 RESULTS</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 24, 1996 -- AST Research, Inc. (ASTA-NASDAQ)
today announced revenues of $612.9 million for the second quarter
of transition period 1995 and $1.016 billion for the six-month
transition period, ended Dec. 30, 1995.  This compares to revenues
of $640.2 million recorded during the prior year quarter and $1.136
billion recorded during the previous year's six-month period.
<P>
AST's 1995 transition period encompasses July 2 through Dec.
30, 1995.  It was created by the decision to change the fiscal
year end from the Saturday closest to June 30, to the Saturday
closest to Dec. 31.
<P>
The company reported a net loss of $128.6 million, or net loss
per share of $2.88 for the second quarter of transition period
1995, compared to a net loss of $21.7 million and net loss per
share of 67 cents recorded during the comparable prior year period.
The second quarter loss includes a $13 million charge for the
previously-announced restructuring of the Pacific Rim manufacturing
operations.  AST reported a net loss of $225.0 million and net
loss per share of $5.27 during the six-month transition period
1995, compared to a net loss of $61.1 million and net loss per
share of $1.89 reported during the previous year's six month period.
<P>
&quot;While the net loss is disappointing, there are some positive
signs contained within the second quarter numbers, including a
significant sequential increase in revenues, growth in international
markets and significant improvements in our balance sheet,&quot;
said Ian Diery, AST president and chief executive officer.  &quot;This
quarter, we focused on improving our sales and laying the foundation
for more improved results.  Lower margins were caused by sales
of older technologies to reduce inventories, shipment delays of
some new products and continued industry pricing pressures.  Significantly
reducing our levels of older inventory should allow us to take
advantage of new, leading-edge products that are scheduled for
introduction during the current quarter.
<P>
&quot;AST's management, board of directors and employees are
dedicated to returning the company to profitability.  Our goal
is to make AST consistently one of the first to market in the
computer industry with leading edge products.  With the help of
our largest shareholder and strategic partner, Samsung Electronics,
AST is driving to shorten and add flexibility to its supply chain
and become the most reliable supplier to the indirect channel,
and hence, their customers.
<P>
&quot;While AST is working extremely hard to meet the challenges
in turning around its business, this is a process which will take
some time and is subject to many risks and uncertainties.&quot;
<P>
International sales of $351.6 million for the quarter reflect
a 24 percent increase over the comparable prior year period, and
included a 32 percent increase in Europe.  Significant year-over-year
sales gains were achieved in the European marketplace, with strong
gains in the Nordic region, as well as the United Kingdom.  The
company also continued to expand its global presence with new
offices in Bangkok, Thailand, and was again reconfirmed by Dataquest
as holding the No. 1 market share position in China.  Total international
revenues during the six-month transition period 1995 were $563.2
million, representing a 25 percent increase over the previous
year's six month period.
<P>
Revenues in the Americas region for the quarter were $261.3 million,
representing a 27 percent decrease from sales recorded during
the comparable prior year period. Total Americas revenues during
the six-month transition period 1995 were $453.1 million, representing
a 34 percent decrease over the prior year six-month period.  The
decrease represents lower consumer retail channel sales during
the period when compared to the prior year period.  During the
first quarter of the transition period 1995, the company significantly
reduced its sales to the domestic consumer retail channel, which
turned around in the last quarter due to increased product offerings.
On a sequential quarter basis, the Americas region experienced
a revenue increase of 36 percent.
<P>
During the second quarter of transition period 1995, AST shipped
339,000 units, including 301,000 desktops and servers and 38,000
notebooks.  Sales of Pentium-based systems represented 84 percent
of total desktop and server units.  Shipments during the six-month
transition period 1995 totaled 514,000 desktops and servers and
70,000 notebooks.
<P>
<B>Balance Sheet Summary</B>
<P>
At Dec. 30, 1995, total cash and cash equivalents were $125.4
million, with $75.0 million in short-term borrowings.  Total net inventory was
$252.3 million, down from $349.2 million at Sept. 30, 1995 and
represented approximately 10 inventory turns.  Accounts receivable
totaled $392.6 million, which represented 58 days sales outstanding,
down from 63 days sales outstanding in the previous quarter.
<P>
During the quarter, AST announced it had entered into an agreement
with Samsung Electronics pursuant to which Samsung would provide
the company with additional credit support in the form of a guaranty
for a $200 million line of credit for two years and a $100 million
vendor credit line for component purchases from Samsung.  As consideration
for this support, AST granted Samsung a five-year option to purchase
up to 4.4 million shares of AST common stock at one-cent per share,
exercisable beginning on July 1, 1996.  If the option is exercised
in full, Samsung's ownership position would increase to approximately
45 percent, from its present position of approximately 40 percent.
<P>
In December, AST obtained a $100 million revolving credit facility
utilizing a portion of the Samsung guarantee and is negotiating
to increase the facility to $200 million.  The company expects
to complete the increase by the end of the current quarter.
<P>
<B>Second Quarter Summary</B>
<P>
During the second quarter, AST experienced significant changes
in upper management, introduced new models to its desktop and
notebook system families and began implementation of its turnaround
plan.  In November, Ian Diery joined the company as president
and chief executive officer, following a successful tenure at
Apple Computer.
<P>
Product deliveries during the quarter included new Premmia and
Bravo business desktop models, as well as new multimedia models
to the Advantage! consumer retail family, featuring the latest
in microprocessors, voice recognition and other technologies.
The company also shipped new Ascentia mobile systems, which collectively
feature some of the industry's fastest processors and largest
displays, and collaborated with Samsung to deliver the Advantage!
Explorer notebook PC to the consumer retail market.
<P>
&quot;We are continuing to work closely with AST as they proceed
with their turnaround plan,&quot; said Won S. Yang, Samsung Electronics
senior executive managing director and an AST board member.  &quot;Our
increased support reflects the confidence we have in management's
efforts and abilities to turn around the company.&quot;
<P>
Except for aforementioned historical information, the forward-looking
statements contained within this news release involve risks and
uncertainties.  Potential risks and uncertainties include, but
are not limited to, continued competitive pricing pressures in
the computer industry; the company's ability to continue to develop,
produce and market products that incorporate new technology on
a timely basis, that are priced competitively and achieve significant
market acceptance; the effect of any continued losses on the company's
supplier and customer relationships; and its needs for liquidity.
Additional information on factors which could affect the company's
 financial results are included in the company's report on Form
10-Q for the first quarter of transition period 1995, which is
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
