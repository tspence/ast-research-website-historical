IRVINE, Calif., May 27, 1997 - Delivering the ultimate computing
solutions for high-performance business users, AST Computer today
announced its innovative new line of Bravo MS desktop computers,
packed with an unprecedented combination of premiere technologies.
 AST's Bravo MS powerhouses combine an innovative design with
the industry's leading hardware and software, creating a robust
computing solution that focuses on lowering the cost of business
computing solutions.
<P>
 &quot;Today's businesses require computing solutions that provide
the perfect combination of performance, features and value to
maximize productivity - and AST has delivered that with the new
Bravo MS,&quot; said Laura Raybin, AST director, brand marketing.
 &quot;AST has responded with a powerful solution that goes beyond
computing needs - the Bravo is designed to actually enhance the
work environment.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>A Winning Ensemble of Hardware Innovations</B></U>
<P>
 Available in desktop or minitower form factors, the Bravo MS
systems incorporate either a 200MHz Intel Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
processor or a 166- or 200MHz Intel Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Processor
with MMX<SUP>&#153;</SUP> technology, 32MB SDRAM standard - expandable
to 256MB, 512KB Level 2 cache, integrated Intel 10/100 Ethernet,
3D audio and an Intel 430TX PCI chipset.
<P>
If that weren't enough, AST packs the latest revolutionary technology
into its Bravo MS, including:
<P>
<I>AST FlexChassis --</I> AST makes serviceability a snap with
the first flexible chassis based on Intel's new NLX standard.
 With a simple push of a button, components such as memory and
the CPU can easily be accessed and serviced, dramatically reducing
the time it takes to upgrade systems.  With the simple flip of
a lever, the motherboard slides out - making upgrades easy and
simple.  AST's ground-breaking industrial design dramatically
reduces upgrades and service time, allowing users to access the
6 major system components: RAM, CPU, CD-ROM, floppy drive, hard
drive and video RAM -- within seconds!
<P>
<I>System Noise Reduction Technology --</I> AST breaks new ground
by introducing the industry's first &quot;Silent PC.&quot;  Building
upon its roots as a pioneer in &quot;Green PC&quot; technology,
AST is the first manufacturer to equip its desktop computers with
SNR technology.  First introduced in Europe by AST, SNR tackles
office noise pollution head-on: reducing system noise by as much
as 70 percent as compared to standard PCs.  A huge relief to offices
with numerous computers operating simultaneously, SNR is also
helpful when engaged in conference calls, training sessions or
when conducting research.
<P>
System noise reduction is one of the biggest advances in computer
design in years.  By incorporating a noise-dampening enclosure,
the mechanical noise emitted from the hard drive is reduced. 
A variable speed fan inside the power supply keeps the system
cool, while operating quietly.  Now, companies have an insurance
policy against 'white noise pollution.' 
<P>
<I>UltraDMA-33 --</I> The Bravo MS also incorporates the latest
revolution in IDE hard drive technology, UltraDMA-33.  Providing
a 10 percent performance increase over standard Programmed Input/Output
(I/O) Mode 4, the Bravo MS boots faster and runs demanding applications
more smoothly.  All new Bravo MS systems feature Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.), which allows the
hard drive to communicate reliability status and can therefore
help to prevent problems before they actually occur.
<P>
<I>ATI RAGE<SUP>&#153;</SUP> II+ </I>-- Maximizing 3D features
and graphics performance, the Bravo MS line incorporates the ATI
RAGE II+, enhancing effects such as video texturing and Gouraud
shading.
<P>
<I>Integrated Ethernet and 16-bit Audio</I> -- The Bravo MS features
an integrated Intel 10/100 Ethernet card, and according to Intel,
provides as much as a 15 percent performance enhancement over
other network cards.  For a new level of 3D stereo sound, AST
includes a Soundblaster-compatible 16-bit integrated audio with
3D effects and a high-quality FM synthesizer.
<P>
<U><B>AST- CommandCenter<SUP>&#153;</SUP> Puts Users In Control</B></U>
<P>
The Bravo MS offers supreme manageability with AST-CommandCenter,
one of the most comprehensive desktop management software utility
packages available.  Offering outstanding software solutions from
the industry's leading software manufacturers, the Bravo MS provides
users with the tools they need to increase office productivity.
 AST-CommandCenter makes management of data and systems faster,
more logical and cost-effective.  This software package provides
a method for tracking hardware and software components currently
residing on a particular PC, system security, anti-virus protection
and much more.
<P>
The Bravo MS features Intel LANDesk<SUP>&#153;</SUP> Client Manger
3.0 software combined with S.M.A.R.T. drive technology to reduce
support requirements and decrease system downtime.  Incorporating
Intel's standard for DMI Asset Management, LANDesk product technology
provides event alerting for temperature, hard drives and other
critical components and adds support for Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
NT<SUP>&reg;</SUP>.
<P>
With award-winning VirusScan<SUP>&#153;</SUP> and WebScan<SUP>&#153;</SUP>
antivirus software from McAfee<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, the Bravo MS protects
users from all types of viruses including Word/Excel macros, boot-sector
infections, encrypted viruses, multi-partite, stealth, polymorphic,
Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Office 97 and Visual Basic<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
4.0 file formats.  These proven antivirus solutions provide a
98 percent detection rate and arm users with a weapon against
the latest method of system infection -- the Internet.
<P>
The first non-IBM manufacturer to empower users with voice recognition
on its desktop computers, AST equips Bravo MS models with Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
95 with IBM VoiceType<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 3.0.  Maximizing office
efficiency, the Bravo MS listens to spoken commands to navigate
through Windows, launch applications, dictate memos and spreadsheets
and surf the Internet.
<P>
