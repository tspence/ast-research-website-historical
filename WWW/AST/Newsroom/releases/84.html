<P>
IRVINE, CALIF, June 11, 1996 -- AST Computer today announced agreements
with Software.com, Inc. and The Internet Factory, Inc., to integrate
the companies' marquee products into AST's turn-key Internet server,
the Manhattan&#153; Commerce PRO&#153;.  This is the first in
a series of agreements to be put in place to bring to market the
Manhattan Commerce PRO, which will be introduced by AST's Advanced
Systems Group June 17 at PC Expo '96 in New York.
<P>
An Internet server like no other, the Manhattan Commerce PRO
will include the extra-powerful hardware and software needed for
Internet and Intranet applications.  &quot;The collaboration between
AST, Software.com and The Internet Factory will offer companies
an easy and cost-effective way to develop and maintain an Internet
presence,&quot; said Chris Norman, Advanced Systems Group marketing
director, AST.  &quot;AST chose to team with these companies not
only because their innovative products fulfill important market
demands, but also because both are committed to consistently being
technology leaders.&quot;<U><I><B> </B></I></U>
<P>
<B>AST and Software.com to Deliver Complete Electronic Messaging</B>
<BR>
 Because today's business computer users depend on their electronic
messaging systems as a primary means of communication, AST chose
to integrate the most complete messaging server software platform
available on the market:  Post.Office.  By including Software.com's
Post.Office, the Manhattan Commerce PRO will provide Internet
users with an easy-to-use, secure Internet server with the highest
level of messaging capabilities and Internet protocol adherence.
<P>
The Manhattan Commerce PRO will offer a complete e-mail package
through Post.Office.  Post.Office provides the industry's best
cross-platform, interoperable messaging solution by using open
standards based on Internet protocols.  In doing so, Post.Office
avoids slow and cumbersome proprietary gateways to achieve higher
performance and full multimedia message fidelity across the Internet.
<P>
&quot;AST is the first hardware manufacturer to understand the
messaging needs of its customers as the world embraces the Internet,&quot;
said Dennis J. Cagan, executive vice president of sales, Software.com.
&quot;Internet messaging is the medium through which business
communications will be done on a global scale.  With Post.Office,
AST customers will have a reliable, proven, secure and feature-rich
turn-key offering that will provide the most complete Internet
messaging server available on the market today.&quot; 
<P>
Post.Office meets the ease-of-use, remote administration, high-performance
and security needs of e-mail users and administrators at small,
medium and large companies alike.  By providing the highest level
of security for Internet servers, system administrators can be
assured that their Internet server will be virtually impossible
to infiltrate.
<P>
<B>AST and The Internet Factory Enable Electronic Commerce
</B>
<BR>
The Internet Factory's Web server/electronic commerce bundle,
Merchant Builder, will enable rapid set-up of an electronic &quot;storefront&quot;
with AST's Manhattan Commerce PRO.  Merchant Builder allows companies
to completely develop a Web site to sell products to customers
over the Internet, from providing initial product information
to securely accepting credit card orders and managing post-sale
delivery information with Internet links to major shippers such
as Federal Express and UPS.
<P>
&quot;AST sees that businesses of all sizes are selling products
over the Internet,&quot; said Ernest Priestly, CEO of The Internet
Factory.  &quot;Using The Internet Factory's secure and easy-to-use
Merchant Builder software on AST's powerful Manhattan Commerce
PRO, businesses can begin servicing their customers and handling
electronic transactions on-line almost immediately.&quot; 
<P>
Conducting electronic business on the Internet is easy
to set up, track and maintain with Merchant Builder's unique development
and maintenance features.  The &quot;Catalog Builder&quot; feature
is a template that allows businesses to input their product pictures
and descriptions, pricing, delivery options and tax rates.  The
remaining &quot;back-office&quot; infrastructure for administration
and maintenance is in place for the business owner to be &quot;on-line&quot;
and in business in just a few short hours.  By including a &quot;ready-to-run&quot;
electronic store, AST's Manhattan Commerce PRO can save business
owners thousands of dollars in custom programming and ongoing
support costs.  Merchant Builder also provides remote administration,
so that a business owner can manage a remotely located Manhattan
Commerce PRO.
<P>
One of the biggest concerns of individuals buying products over
the Internet is security. Merchant Builder eliminates this concern
by allowing encryption of all customer credit card and personal
information using industry standard RSA Secure Sockets Layer protocol
(SSL). Similarly, business owners can protect against unauthorized
access to administrative functions by the program's use of SSL
encryption plus passwords for various levels of remote administration.
