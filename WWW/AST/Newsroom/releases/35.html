<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman">IRVINE, Calif., August 8, 1997 - <B>AST Research
Inc.</B> (ASTA-NASDAQ) today confirmed the expiration of the tender offer
by <B>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</B> to purchase all of the outstanding
shares of AST stock that Samsung did not already own at a price of $5.40
per share.<BR>
The company also announced it understands that the merger between AST and
a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics (with AST being the surviving corporation)
will be completed earlier than August 25 as was previously-announced. The
revised date for the completion of the merger is now August 11.<BR>
<I>&quot;Completing the merger sooner than expected allows AST to focus
more intensely on satisfying the needs of our customers,&quot;</I> said
S.T. Kim, AST president and chief executive officer. <I>&quot;It also allows
the company to devote even greater resources and attention towards returning
the company to profitability and a market growth position.&quot;</I><BR>
AST has been informed that 28,537,986 shares (approximately 90% of the outstanding
shares not owned by Samsung or its affiliates) had been tendered as of Aug.
8. Adding the tendered shares of AST common stock to the shares already
owned by Samsung or its affiliates represents approximately 95 percent of
the total outstanding shares of AST.<BR>
AST expects cash payments to be sent during the week of Aug. 11 to shareholders
who have tendered their shares. Shareholders of record who have not tendered
their shares will soon be sent instructions on how they may receive cash
payments by submitting their shares of AST stock.<BR>
As previously announced, record holders of Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs)
issued by AST will be sent instructions in early September specifying how
they may redeem their notes for cash. The company expects LYONs to be redeemable
on or about Oct. 1, 1997.<BR>
