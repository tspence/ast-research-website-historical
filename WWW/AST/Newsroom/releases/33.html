IRVINE, Calif., May 27, 1997 - Silently conquering office noise
pollution, AST&reg; Computer today whispered that its latest Bravo
MS commercial desktop computers are the first U.S. commercial
PCs to be equipped with System Noise Reduction (SNR) technology.
 Dramatically reducing the dissonant noise that resounds through
every office, the new Bravo MS computer line is as much as 70
percent quieter than other leading business PCs.
<P>
&quot;We've consulted with our corporate customers and responded
with business solutions that help their employees work better
and faster,&quot; said Laura Raybin, AST director, brand marketing.
 &quot;Our Bravo MS systems are packed with leading-edge hardware
and software, in a package that's conducive to maximum office
efficiency.  This innovative technology is truly ground breaking.&quot;
<P>
After its successful launch into the European market, AST brings
SNR technology to U.S. businesses for the first time.  AST's quiet
Bravo PCs give users relief from noise distractions when concentrating
on important projects or engaging in conference calls.  In large
offices with numerous computers running simultaneously, SNR technology
creates a significantly more pleasant and productive work environment.
<P>
&quot;With the commercial market growing more competitive, there
is growing attention among PC vendors to address environmental
concerns in the workplace,&quot; said Kevin Hause, analyst, personal
systems research, International Data Corporation.  &quot;Reducing
system noise levels can have a potential for a positive impact
on workplace productivity.&quot;

AST breaks new ground with its latest Bravo MS commercial desktops
by introducing the industry's first &quot;Silent PC.&quot;  Building
upon its roots as a pioneer in &quot;Green PC&quot; technology,
AST is the first manufacturer to equip its desktop computers with
SNR technology.  First introduced in Europe by AST, SNR tackles
office noise pollution head-on - reducing system noise by as much
as 70 percent as compared to standard PCs.  A huge relief to offices
with numerous computers operating simultaneously, SNR is also
helpful when engaged in conference calls, training sessions or
when conducting research.
<P>
 System noise reduction is one of the biggest advances in computer
design in years.  By incorporating a noise-dampening enclosure,
the mechanical noise emitted from the hard drive is reduced. 
A variable speed fan inside the power supply keeps the system
cool, while operating quietly.  Now, companies have an insurance
policy against 'white noise pollution.'

A pioneer in environmentally-friendly computing with its 1993
award-winning Bravo LP &quot;Green PC&quot; line, AST continues
its leadership role by being the first PC manufacturer to take
to heart the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's
(NIOSH) &quot;Buy Quiet&quot; policy for new equipment purchases.
 Exceeding the NIOSH guidelines for office noise exposure, AST's
Bravo MS runs at 28dB - 57dB quieter than the recommended exposure
limit for office equipment.
<P>
 According to the Bureau of Census data, an estimated 30 million
American workers are 'noise exposed' on a daily basis.  For example,
the noise generated from one PC can generate  35-40 decibels -
almost the level of a normal conversation.  Imagine what this
can mean with a room full of PCs!  More businesses are beginning
to recognize that noise pollution does indeed impact productivity
and have adopted guidelines for selecting new computers through
this &quot;Buy Quiet&quot; policy.  The New AST Bravo MS systems
allow corporate users to meet these guidelines today.
