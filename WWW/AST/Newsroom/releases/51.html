<B>IRVINE, Calif. - August 5, 1996 -</B> Proving that good things
come in small packages, AST Computer (NASDAQ -- ASTA) announced
today that its Ascentia J Series of notebook computers has recently
been awarded top honors from three of the industry's most prestigious
publications: <I>WINDOWS Magazine's</I> Win 100 Award; <I>PC Magazine's</I>
Editors' Choice Award; and <I>PC Week's</I> Analyst's Choice Award.
<P>
&quot;With accolades such as these, we are confident that AST
will remain ahead of the competition,&quot; said Mark Marlow,
director of mobile product marketing for AST Computer.  &quot;The
Ascentia line of notebook computers is exactly what today's mobile
user is looking for - an exceptional PC that combines performance
and functionality at an aggressive price.&quot;
<P>
<I>PC Magazine</I> bestowed its Editors' Choice Award (August,
1996) to the Ascentia J50 and described it as &quot;intended for
users with demanding applications that require a high-performance
system.&quot;  The article went on to say, &quot;This Pentium/133
portable was a top-notch performer in its class and it offers
a lithium ion battery as well as a 14.4Kbps fax modem.&quot; 
Run through a myriad of benchmarks and other high-performance
tests, AST's Ascentia J50 outshines the competition in performance
and price.
<P>
&quot;Well-suited for computer-based presentations, the Ascentia
J30's basic configuration should meet the needs of almost any
notebook computer user,&quot; wrote <I>WINDOWS Magazine</I>, in
its Summer 1996 issue.  The Ascentia J30 was chosen as part of
the Win 100 Awards as the notebook computer of choice based on
power, functionality and capability above and beyond other products
in its class.  In addition, <I>WINDOWS Magazine</I> highlighted
AST's use of significantly new technology. 
<P>
<I>PC Week</I> (June 3,1996) presented its Analyst's Choice Award
to the Ascentia J50, commenting that AST has &quot;bucked the
trend of ushering a new processor to market by providing fast
performance in a small package at a reasonable price.&quot;  Beating
out competition such as IBM and Compaq, the sleek Ascentia J50
proved to be faster, better and less expensive.  In extensive
testing, the Ascentia J50 ran 16-bit and 32-bit applications effortlessly.
As evidenced by PC Week, &quot;In a crowd of 133MHz notebooks,
Ascentia is the head-turner.&quot;
