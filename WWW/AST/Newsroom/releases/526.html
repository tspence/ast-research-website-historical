<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Reorganization Will Include Personnel Reductions of </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">1,120 Employees Worldwide</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Irvine, Calif.</B>, Dec. 3, 1997 – AST Research, Inc. announced plans to reorganize its worldwide operations as part of an overall effort to re-focus its business on tighter market segments and enhance its ability to be more flexible in meeting the demands of the increasingly competitive PC marketplace. The reorganization will include an overhaul of worldwide operations, including functional consolidations, the advancement of key operational synergies with its parent Samsung Electronics, and worldwide personnel reductions that may eventually amount to approximately 37 percent of the total workforce. </P>
<P>&#9;Elements of the reorganization announced today are directed at the company’s North American and Asian operations. The company said that reorganization steps related to its European operations would be finalized and announced within the next two weeks.</P>
<P>&#9;"AST has taken previous steps to restructure which have been beneficial but have not gone far enough," said S.T. Kim, President and Chief Executive Officer of AST. "This reorganization is driven by our recognition that in order to effect a real shift in strategy to carry us to a full recovery, we must first establish a top-line revenue target that is achievable."</P>
<P>&#9;Mr. Kim continued, "Beyond that, we must get AST to the point where it can grow again and, from there, become an industry leader. This requires definitive action of the sort we are taking today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"Looking squarely at our recent performance in the context of the competitive landscape for PCs, our long-term goal can no longer be simply to sell more PCs to more customers," Mr. Kim said. "There is a place for a smart and nimble player to become the PC solutions provider for critical emerging target markets. The strategic and operational changes we are announcing today will result in a leaner organization in which decisions can be made faster and we can more effectively meet the needs of a changing marketplace. AST is uniquely positioned to occupy this position, because we have the best of both worlds – the heart and legacy of an entrepreneur <B><I>and</B></I> the global presence and experience of Samsung."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The reorganization reflects a fundamental shift in business strategy for the company. The main elements of the new strategy include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Re-focusing target markets, with a particular emphasis on small- and medium-sized businesses and selected global corporate accounts </LI>
<LI>Focusing on selected global geographic markets </LI>
<LI>Establishing flexible manufacturing capabilities and reducing the order-to-delivery cycle, including implementing a build-to-order distribution model, in order to better meet customer demands and reduce inventory risk </LI>
<LI>Re-aligning the company’s organizational structure, including building stronger relationships with resellers and end-users, to focus on customer "pull" demand generation </LI>
<LI>Streamlining the sales, development and manufacturing functions in a way that positions AST closer to its customers </LI>
<LI>Reducing back-end costs </LI>
<LI>Increasing emphasis on share of quality and service differentiation, including an expansion of AST’s successful customer care programs such as Entrepreneurial Edge for emerging companies and K.A.R.E. (Key Accounts Response for Excellence) for larger corporate accounts</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Among the specific aspects of the reorganization announced by AST today are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Primary corporate functions based at AST’s Irvine, California headquarters will remain in Irvine, while supply-related functions will be transferred to the company’s main manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Departments that will remain in Irvine include corporate office, finance, human resources, sales and marketing, information systems, research and development, advanced product development and product planning. This move is intended to streamline the production chain in order to increase the company’s capability to get product to market quickly. It is also designed to enable the company to become more responsive to customer demands by improving communications among product support functions. In addition, the Fort Worth facility’s manufacturing capacity will be scaled down. </LI>
<LI>In Asia, AST will fortify its relationship with Samsung through a cooperative manufacturing arrangement at its main plant in Dongguan, China. Current sales facilities in Southeast Asia and Australia will be phased out, and Samsung will manage the customer support function in those regions. In addition, AST will consolidate its Asia/Pacific sales operations in markets that have historically been strong for AST, such as China. </LI>
<LI>AST is continuing its review of European operations with the objective of supporting the company’s new strategy, including re-focusing target markets and streamlining operations. Details will be announced in coming weeks.</LI></UL>

<P>Tom Scott, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing and Sales of AST, explained, "The critical outcome of these moves is the realization of meaningful changes in our business model to focus on our strongest customer markets. Given this new focus, we must be able to reduce response time so that our customers can get what they want when they want it which, in today’s marketplace, means within a few days. As we cut our order-to-delivery cycles to a fraction of their former levels, we will not only be interacting more intimately with our resellers and end-users, we will also significantly reduce inventory risk for AST and our resellers."</P>
<P>&#9;Mr. Scott added, "We need to pull demand through our resellers by maintaining a presence in the mind’s-eye of our core customer base, and this reorganization is being made with that goal in our sights." Mr. Scott said that this will include greater reliance on "virtual" interaction with customers and resellers – via the Internet, for example – for technical support and order fulfillment.</P>
<P>&#9;He added that the reorganization will not incorporate any product line cancellations. "Focusing on our strongest customer markets and streamlining our operations means that we will be better equipped to provide the total technology solution for our customers, and we intend to do so by maintaining a comprehensive array of products and backing them up with service and support that reflects our dedication to these specific segments. It’s much easier to provide excellent service if you are not trying to be all things to all people."</P>
