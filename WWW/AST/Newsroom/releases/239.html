</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>AssuranceONE is the official name for the notebook insurance program provided through SAFEWARE. It is a trademark of AST Research, Inc. Service would like to clarify a few facts pertaining to this new notebook insurance program that is being provided by SAFEWARE. The flier that was distributed a couple of weeks ago had an error.</P>
<B><P>Pertaining to the bullet that stated "Damaged units can receive ExpressONE service", this IS NOT a true statement.</P>
</B><P>This insurance coverage is a stand alone service provided by SAFEWARE. <B>Service is currently looking into combining both ExpressONE and SAFEWARE programs. However, we DO NOT CURRENTLY offer this option.</P>
</B><P>Currently, if a unit is stolen or has damages not covered by ExpressONE (i.e., items not covered by standard warranty), the customer would have to make a claim to SAFEWARE just like any other insurance claim. As with insurance claims, the customer would have to wait a certain amount of time for the insurance company claim to be processed.</P>
<P>We apologize for any confusion that this may have caused. If you have any questions or concerns pertaining to this program, please direct them to Sandy Ormerod and she will make sure the proper party answers your question.</P>
