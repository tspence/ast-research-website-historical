<P><CENTER><B>Desktop Performance Meets Notebook Power Management as AST
Prepares to Incorporate Intel's 430TX PCIset Into Its Award Winning Mobile
and Desktop Computers</B></CENTER></P>

<P>IRVINE, Calif., February 17, 1997 - Responding to business customers'
needs for computing solutions that increase office productivity, AST Computer&REG;
(NASDAQ:ASTA) today announced that its Bravo commercial desktop computers
and Ascentia&#153; mobile computers will incorporate Intel's new core logic
chipset, the 430TX PCIset. The newest addition to Intel's family of PCIsets,
the 430TX optimizes performance while minimizing power consumption in AST's
Pentium processor-based desktop and mobile systems.</P>

<P>&quot;We're committed to delivering innovative technology solutions to
our customers, and the addition of Intel's 430TX chipset demonstrates that
commitment&quot; stated AST's Laura Raybin, AST's director of worldwide
product planning for commercial desktops and advanced systems. &quot;Our
close relationship with Intel enables us to provide our customers with the
latest in product design, improved power consumption and enhanced performance.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Bravo Takes System Performance to the Next Level</B><BR>
According to Intel, systems incorporating the 430TX will provide a 10 to
15 percent increase in overall performance. The industry's most integrated
and advanced core logic offers improved SDRAM performance, giving Bravo
users an increase in Windows&REG; performance. The chipset's Ultra DMA-33
support will boost users' maximum data retrieval speeds to 33MB/s. Supporting
the latest system bus and power management technologies, AST's Bravo line
will be the perfect vehicle for today's media-rich business applications.</P>

<P><B>Ascentia Provides Desktop Power in a Portable Solution</B> <BR>
The Ascentia Z Series of portable computers will be designed with Intel's
430TX PCIset, bringing desktop power and functionality to a notebook platform.
With core logic that closely monitors user activity, the Ascentia systems
will greatly reduce power consumption and increase battery life - an important
consideration for business travelers. Notebooks equipped with the 430TX
will also offer three options for power management, maximizing flexibility
for users on the go.</P>

<P><B>Availability</B><BR>
AST's Ascentia Z Series of notebook computers and Bravo corporate desktop
computers with the 430TX PCIset are scheduled for availability during the
second quarter of 1997.</P>
