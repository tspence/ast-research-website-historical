<P>IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 6, 1997 – AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer is using COMDEX 1997 as a showcase for introducing the marriage of AST and Samsung Electronics America. AST and Samsung have joined forces to create one of the largest exhibits displayed at this year’s COMDEX, which is being held at the Las Vegas Convention Center from Nov. 17-21.</P>
<P>The booth pavilion – #L1248/1647 – will have more than 15,000 sq. ft. and serve as a showcase for the companies’ newest products, programs, and technologies. This will include the fault tolerance features of the new AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Server line, the security features and Trillion<FONT SIZE=2>&trade;</FONT> Technology that make the Ascentia<FONT SIZE=2>&trade;</FONT> M series of notebook computers the smartest mobile computing solution in the market, and the manageability and ease-of-use features that make the Bravo commercial desktops so popular. AST will also introduce its new Ovation!<FONT SIZE=2>&trade;</FONT> reseller program, providing additional support to the channel at a time when many vendors are reducing their support.</P>
<P>"COMDEX will showcase the advantages of the AST/Samsung merger," said S.T. Kim, AST’s president and chief executive officer. "We’re sending a strong message to the world that we are back, we are committed to growing our business in terms of both profitability and market share, and we want to significantly expand our relationship with resellers."</P>

<P>To bring the exhibit’s theme – "Building A Better Future Together" – to life, AST and Samsung have joined with The Planetary Society to display the only replica of the Mars Rover. AST is also sponsoring a live concert featuring legendary blues guitarist B.B. King. This exclusive invitation-only concert will serve as a forum to strengthen relationships with resellers, customers, media and other business partners. To further leverage its COMDEX presence, AST is working with its major suppliers – such as Microsoft and Intel – to share products and personnel.</P>
