<B>AST-IntraAccess Standard On New Bravo MS-T Pentium&#174; Pro
Processor-Based Commercial Desktops </B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., July 22, 1996 -- AST Computer (NASDAQ-ASTA) today
strengthened its position as being first-to-market with leading
edge technology with its first-of-a-kind AST-IntraAccess&#153; software
bundle.  Now shipping on new Bravo MS-T Pentium&#174; Pro processor-based
commercial desktops, AST-IntraAccess provides commercial customers with a complete
network browsing and Web authoring software bundle, and includes
all of the software that is necessary to make sharing data via
a company Intranet a breeze.
<P>
AST-IntraAccess represents the latest addition to AST-CommandCenter,
the company's third generation of desktop utilities, optimized
and tuned for the Microsoft Windows&#174; NT Workstation environment.
With AST-IntraAccess, business users are able to extend communications
within their business and internal organizational enterprises.
Commercial organizations and individuals looking to effectively
and efficiently harness the Internet and Intranet today now have
the power at their fingertips.
<P>
&quot;We have taken the commercial PC to the next dimension by
incorporating software that will be critical for conducting business
in an increasingly Web-centric environment,&quot; stated AST's
Laura Raybin, director of product marketing for commercial desktops.
 &quot;Staying on the cusp of information is critical to making
strategic and important business decisions, and AST-IntraAccess
helps give users that leading edge.&quot;
<P>
Included in the AST-IntraAccess toolkit are NETCOMplete&#153;, Internet
Factory's Communication Builder&#153;, Netscape Navigator&#153; and HoTMetaL&#153;
Light from SoftQuad.
<P>
&quot;We are very pleased to be including HoTMetaL Light with
quality AST products,&quot; said Dave Gurney, Chairman and CEO
of SoftQuad.  &quot;By bundling HoTMetaL Light with AST's Bravo
desktop computer, we continue to supply high-powered solutions
for creating dynamic Web pages for Internets and corporate Intranets.&quot;
<P>
AST recognizes that integrating these superior software tools
with the newest Bravo desktops enables users to more fully utilize
the burgeoning growth of both Internet and Intranet software applications.
<P>
&quot;We recognize that one of the most compelling reasons for
utilizing the Internet and Intranet is the ability of software
tools, such as those contained within AST-IntraAccess, to more
fully and completely support commercial applications,&quot; noted
Raybin.  &quot;This in turn extends the existing applications
investments made by business customers today.&quot;
<P>
Similar to the thinking of several technology analysts today,
AST is of the opinion that worldwide business use of Internet/Intranet
software is exploding.
<P>
&quot;We know that in 1996 approximately $15 million dollars
will be spent by commercial users on Internet/Intranet software,&quot;
Raybin stated.  &quot;We envision this figure growing to well
over $75 million by the end of this century.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Sweeping The Globe</B></U>
<BR>
AST believes that the Internet revolution is sweeping the globe,
and AST-IntraAccess helps make it possible for small, medium and
large-sized businesses to have an almost instant presence on the
Internet.  The company believes that there are between 10 and
12 million users now accessing the World Wide Web, with more than
fifty percent of large corporations having daily access to the
Web.
<P>
&quot;We think it is quite feasible that by the end of this year
more than seventy-five percent of large corporations will be doing
business on the Web,&quot; noted Raybin.  &quot;With AST-IntraAccess,
an organization can more effectively manage the problem of information
overload - because recipients can access exactly that specific
information relevant to them.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>All-In-One Tool Kit</B></U>
<BR>
With AST-IntraAccess, making an organization's information available
electronically is dramatically more efficient.  Electronic information
can be easily disseminated, stored, altered, updated and even
accessed on a large scale.
<P>
&quot;We have determined that the amount of time a user spends
looking for critical information, let's say competitive tracking
statistics, can be reduced by as much as much as twenty percent
with an in-house Intranet solution,&quot; stated Raybin.  &quot;What
this means is that both the customers and employees benefit.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>An Array of Business-Enhancing WEB Software</B></U>
<BR>
AST-IntraAccess gives users all of the necessary pieces to be
up and running in a WEB environment in very little time. Combining
these software tools into one bundle saves users potentially hundreds
of dollars off of the retail price for each software product if
purchased separately. 
<P>
<I>NETCOM Internet Service</I>
<BR>
AST's preferred Internet Service Provider (ISP) is NETCOM.
As the nation's leading commercial ISP, NETCOM provides full
service Internet connections to corporate users, as well as host
dial-up service to individual and small business customers.
<P>
<I>NETCOMplete</I><BR>
As a complete Internet kit, NETCOMplete includes a wide variety
of the most popular software available.  NETCOMplete includes
a protocol stack and dialer with an intuitive Windows interface
that lets you point and click through a full range of services
including electronic mail, the World Wide Web, news groups and
&quot;chat rooms.&quot;
<P>
<I>Netscape Navigator</I>
<BR>
Surfing the Internet for the latest stock information and technology
trend watching is quick and hassle-free with Netscape's Navigator,
widely recognized as the best Web browser available.
<P>
This incredible application supports both HTML 3.0 and multiple
documents so that you can access the latest in Web graphics and
open multiple windows simultaneously.
<P>
<I>Internet Factory's Communications Builder</I> 
<BR>
Creating a home page on the World Wide Web as well as creating
an internal Web or Intranet is a snap with Communications Builder.
Communications Builder acts as an HTTP proxy server, or &quot;gateway&quot;
to pass information between an organization's internal network
and the Internet.  Acting as a proxy server, multiple requests
for the same document can be fulfilled with a local cache, eliminating
the need to traverse the network.  When acting as a &quot;gateway&quot;,
Communications Builder allows for other resources to access the
Internet via the server where the gateway is located.
<P>
<I>HoTMetaL Light</I>
<BR>
Authoring Web Internet/Intranet pages is painless with SoftQuad's
HoTMetaL Light authoring tool, helping users to be creative and
get their message out in new and clever ways.
<P>
With an internal &quot;home page,&quot; known as Intranet, users
can share policies, procedures and reference manuals online.
<P>
The Web page creation features of HoTMetaL Light helps you do
all of this in conjunction with Communications Builder.
