</B><P>The results are in and the critics have given a big two thumbs up for "AST's Combined Launch Kits". For the first time in AST history, we launched the New Ascentia M, Bravo MS PII, Premium HS Servers, programs and services, all in one kit! You may have already received your kit or will be receiving them within the next 2-4 days. </P>
<P>Look in your kit for the "AST Marketing Material Profile" (it's the second page). This exciting new piece has all the part numbers for product brochures, technology overviews, program and service brochures. We just made it easier for you to place all your collateral orders from JP Marketing. </P>
<B><P>New Peripherals &amp; Accessories Catalog</P>
</B><P>Beginning in mid-October, AST will begin including a new peripherals and accessories catalog in each system box sold. We have retained PORT Inc. to manage our peripherals and accessories products. They are currently finalizing our first catalog, which will be updated on a quarterly basis.</P>
<P>PORT Inc. has been in the computer accessories business for some time and has extensive experience with many vendors in the industry.</P>
<P>As we finalize additional details of our working relationship with PORT, we'll send out a Marketing Bulletin to the field and our reseller partners to inform everyone of the program.</P>

</B><P>Typo in the Ascentia brochure. We'll fix with the next print. </P>
<P>Ascentia M Features/back page:</P><DIR>

<P>&#9;"Max. resolution (12.1 DSTN and 12.1 TFT)" should read "800 x 600 x 24-bit" not "800 x 600 x 256"</P>
<P>&#9;"Max. resolution (13.3 XGA) should read "1024 x 768 x 16-bit"</P>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Docking Update</P>
</B><P>Mini is shipping, full docking station is shipping very soon, port replicator is still tbd.</P>
<B><P>Mobile Options Pricing Update</P>
</B><P>In the mad rush to launch, we had some discrepancies in the mobile options pricing. The price sheet found in your launch binder has the most up to date pricing and you should use this in quoting prices on the Ascentia M Series options. Ellen Inouye is finalizing the October Price List currently and it will begin distribution towards the latter part of next week (approximately October 3). From that point forward, please use the October Price List.</P>
