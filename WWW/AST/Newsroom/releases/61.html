LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 1996 -- Taking the entry-level server market
by storm, AST Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA) today introduces at COMDEX
'96 the Manhattan D Series of entry-level workgroup servers and
the Manhattan Presence Pro, a complete Internet server solution.
 Remarkably-priced, AST's new Manhattan servers offer complete
solutions at a cost comparable to a high-end desktop.  The fully-integrated
Manhattan servers have a 200MHz Intel Pentium Pro processor, an
Intel 440FX chipset, ten drive bays, abundant RAM memory and are
packed with other state-of-the-art hardware.  This powerful combination
of hardware and technology provides the functionality, power and
reliability needed to optimize 32-bit software.  With estimated
street prices starting at under $4,000, AST's new Manhattan servers
confirm AST's commitment to offer an expanded base of server solutions
at industry-leading prices.
<P>
The Manhattan D Series and the Manhattan Presence Pro are designed
for customers who want a powerful server solution, complete with
the latest technologies and features, without having to pay a
high price.  These new Manhattan servers are AST's latest products
in the entry-level server segment and were designed to complement
the company's current high-end, dual Pentium Pro processor product
line.
<P>
&quot;The entry-level server market is booming and is targeted
as one of the fastest growing segments in the server marketplace.
AST has taken the lead by providing low-cost entry-level solutions
ideal for first-time server sites, remote branch offices and larger
offices requiring an additional server,&quot; explained Laura
Raybin, director, commercial products group at AST.  &quot;Entry-level
does not mean low-performance with AST's new Manhattan servers.
Any business that runs mission-critical applications and needs
a reliable, strong-performance, easy-to-manage solution, will
be well suited with the Manhattan D Series or the Manhattan Presence
Pro.  AST is committed to providing customers and reseller partners
with the most comprehensive and complete server solutions available
- all at industry-leading price points.&quot;
<P>
AST is continuing to implement its well-defined server strategy
introduced last spring, by providing a complete line of server
solutions focused on Pentium Pro processors and Microsoft Windows
NT&#153; Server technologies.  AST's Manhattan servers, including the
Manhattan Commerce PRO and Manhattan S6200, have been acclaimed
by the media for their design, technology implementation and reliability.
Recently, the Manhattan Commerce PRO was selected by <I>PC/Computing</I>
as a finalist in the &quot;Best Web Server&quot; category for
their 1996 MVP Awards, to be announced here at Comdex.  The Manhattan
D Series and the Manhattan Presence Pro are the latest additions
to AST's expanding technology-driven product lines. 
<P>
<B>Manhattan D Series</B>
<BR>
AST's Manhattan D Series is a high-performance entry-level server
solution complete with a 200MHz Intel Pentium Pro processor and
an Intel 440FX chipset for unmatched speed and performance.  To
provide the power to optimize 32-bit software, the Manhattan D
Series has 32MB ECC EDO memory expandable to 512MB, integrated
ultra wide SCSI, an 8X CD-ROM drive, 256KB level two cache, four
DIMM sites, three PCI slots, two EISA slots, integrated PCI graphics
and 100Mbit Ethernet and Intel LANDesk&#174; Server Manager
for complete network management.  
<P>
Designed in a small, convenient form factor, the Manhattan D
Series has a minitower chassis with six internal drive bays and
a hard drive expansion to support a generous 24GB of storage.
The Manhattan D Series is tested, certified and optimized for
Novell&#174; NetWare&#174; and IntranetWare&#174;, as well as Microsoft Windows
NT Server, so customers can be confident that the network operating
systems will operate flawlessly.  AST has also bundled Microsoft
Windows NT and Novell&#174; NetWare&#174; basic configuration
education software by CBT on the Manhattan D Series and the Manhattan
Presence Pro, allowing end users to optimize operating system
performance.
<P>
&quot;Many businesses today are running their network through
a high-end desktop computer to compensate for high-priced servers.
With the introduction of the new entry-level Manhattan servers,
customers can get the performance, availability, reliability and
manageability of a high-performance server -- all for the price
of a desktop,&quot; stated Raybin.  
<P>
<B>Manhattan Presence Pro</B>
<BR>
Building upon the powerhouse hardware of the Manhattan D Series,
the Manhattan Presence Pro is configured with a complete suite

of hours, the Manhattan Presence Pro is pre-installed with Microsoft
Windows NT Server, an easy-to-manage yet powerful network operating
system with comprehensive file, print and communications services.
<P>
&quot;AST's high-end Internet server, the Manhattan Commerce
PRO, has been acclaimed by the media and the industry as one of
the most complete Internet solutions available,&quot; explained
Raybin.  &quot;Our latest entry-level Internet server, the Manhattan
Presence Pro, also provides a complete solution, and is especially
configured for customers and resellers who may be new to the Internet
and want to enter the market through the means of a low-cost,
easy-to-use solution.  We have provided that with the Manhattan
Presence Pro.&quot;
<P>
AST's Manhattan Presence Pro includes Merchant Builder Server
software from The Internet Factory.  This advanced software provides
secure Web transaction capability for electronic commerce and
protects the Internet server from unwelcome intrusion.  Able to
support JAVA, Merchant Builder also enables remote administration,
multi-homing/hosting and chat rooms.
<P>
Also bundled is SoftQuad's HoTMetaL&#153; Light, which allows home
page creation and editing.  It supports the HTML standards and
Netscape&#153; Navigator extensions.  For an easy connection to the
Internet, AST continues its strategic partnership with NETCOM&#153;
On-Line Communication Services, Inc., to provide a complete Internet
connectivity component on the Manhattan Presence Pro.  In addition,
the Manhattan Presence Pro includes the Verity search engine and
complete E-mail server software with Software.com's Post.Office&#153;
for E-mail capability both internally and through the Internet.
