IRVINE, Calif., July 31, 1996 -- Arming corporate customers with
the latest in technology, AST Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA) announced
that its new server and commercial desktop offerings come equipped
with Microsoft&#174; Windows NT&#174; operating systems.  AST's Bravo commercial
desktops are bundled with Windows NT Workstation, and AST's Manhattan&#153;
server products come preloaded with Windows NT Server.  
<P>
Future commercial desktop offerings, slated for later this summer,
will be bundled with Microsoft's recently announced Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 and forthcoming server products will come equipped
with Windows NT Server 4.0. 
<P>
&quot;With high performance, industrial strength, reliability
and security, Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server provide
corporate users with the easiest network operating system for
the most demanding business needs,&quot; stated Dan Sheppard,
director of worldwide product marketing.  &quot;There has been
an overwhelming demand from both our end-users and the channel
for an operating system that is multi-purpose and scales from
the workgroup to the enterprise -- Windows NT Server and Windows
NT Workstation deliver this functionality.&quot;
<P>
Windows NT Workstation is designed to provide the highest level
of system reliability and data protection for demanding environments
including transaction processing, graphics handling and other
mission critical applications.    
<P>
With Microsoft Windows NT Server, users gain access to a robust,
multi-purpose network operating system that offers high-performance
file and print services while providing the infrastructure to
run powerful client-server applications.
<P>
&quot;We applaud AST for committing to deliver leading-edge technology
to their customers,&quot;  said Jonathan Roberts, director of
desktop marketing at Microsoft Corp.  &quot;Financial applications,
data analysis and a host of other data-intensive and power-hungry
applications are a breeze with the combination of AST's Bravo
and Manhattan products with our new Windows NT Workstation 4.0
and Windows NT Server operating systems.&quot;

AST has designed its Bravo MS-T 6180 and 6200 desktops to take
advantage of 32-bit applications and to address the needs of corporate

<P>
The new Bravo minitowers pack a powerful punch with Intel's fastest
