<P>CD-ROM Origins</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> When the developers of the Compact Disc (CD) sat down to design it, they were primarily focused on the use of the disc as a revolutionary new medium for sound recordings, specifically high fidelity music.  It was only later that they expanded the use of the medium to encompass a hodgepodge of other applications and content such as interactive CD’s, games containing mixtures of audio and video and still frames, video from feature movies, computer data, and writeable CD formats.   Over time this led to a series of standards, or books,  referred to as Red Book, Yellow Book, Green Book, and Orange Book, which defined the details of the data formats for each of the variations</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The track layout for the CD is similar in many ways to that of the vinyl phonograph record it was intended to replace, since of course, audio playback was the primary application.   The digital audio samples, recorded at a rate of 44,100 samples per second, need to arrive at the playback electronics at regularly spaced intervals of time to minimize the need for expensive memory buffers in the drive.  To accomplish this, the data is recorded on the disc in a continuous spiral track similar to that on a phonograph record, and the rotational speed of the disc is controlled to keep the data coming off of the disc at a constant, well-controlled rate. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This continuous spiral track leads to a second benefit during audio playback, since the pick-up head simply follows the &quot;groove&quot; as it does on a phonograph record, rather than jumping around from track to track and sector to sector as on a computer disk drive.  The relatively smooth tracking motion and slow speed allow the motor and electronics in the drive to be built much more inexpensively and with lower power consumption than those in a computer disk drive, allowing CD Audio drives to reach the low price points and degree of portability available in the stores today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However, the format for the CD departs from that of the phonograph record in one significant detail.  The phonograph record spins at a constant RPM, 33 1/3, 45, or 78 RPM, which is more or less tightly controlled depending on how much the consumer was (or is, for the vinyl collectors) willing to spend.  Moreover, due to the physics of the vinyl disc, the groove with the recorded sound waves moves by the pickup needle at an increasingly slower rate as the pickup arm makes its way toward the center of the record.  Thus the peaks and valleys of the sound waves are packed more tightly together on the inner portions of the record than they are on the outer portions.  This leads to what might be described in computer terms as a higher &quot;bit packing density&quot; on the inner diameter of the record, and a lower &quot;bit packing density&quot; on the outer diameter.  From the standpoint of data capacity, or expressed differently, in the length of audio playback time, this method leads to an inefficient use of the limited area available on a CD disc.  So the CD designers decided to make the maximum use of the limited space available and use a constant &quot;bit packing density&quot; on the disc,  compensating for the potential variable playback rate by instead continuously varying the spin speed of the disc, as the head moves between inner and outer diameters, to provide a constant data playback rate.  This method of playback is referred to as CLV, or Constant Linear Velocity, playback.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For audio recordings, the initial design was just fine.  But in the quest to add game content and data storage for the multimedia computer environment, the drive was simply too slow.  This led to rapid improvements in both the data seek time for random data accesses and in the sustained data transfer rate.  The drives quickly progressed from &quot;1X&quot; for the initial drives to &quot;2X&quot;, and then to 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and now 16X.   Each of these &quot;X&quot; designations refers to how fast the new drives transfer data relative to the original drive, referred to as &quot;1X&quot;.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evolution was pushed along by the establishment of MPC (Multimedia PC) standards for computer systems which defined minimum requirements for such things as processor speed, memory capacity, sound playback capability, and CDROM transfer rate and access time.  The initial standard, MPC I, specified a minimum  &quot;1X&quot; drive, and MPC II specified a minimum &quot;2X&quot; drive.  Current standards require as a minimum a &quot;4x&quot; drive with less than 250 ms average access time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The various &quot;X&quot; factors through 8X, the associated sustained transfer rates, and the MPC level requirements supported are summarized in the table below.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P>The Migration to 8X</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The migration from single speed drives to eight speed drives took place over a period of about three years, and was accomplished by redesigning the playback mechanism and motor, servo, and read channel electronics to accommodate the higher spin speeds and higher data output rates.  This migration was not without pain and uncertainty, because the original CD was designed to spin at a relatively slow speed of 500 RPM, and the move to 8X required spin speeds of over 4000 RPM, comparable to spin speeds on hard disk drives.  The CD disc is a relatively imprecise piece of plastic, not well suited to spin at high speeds like the more precise aluminum platters in a hard disk drive, and drives designers had to overcome problems with vibration, heat dissipation, and read error rate to produce a reliable product.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The CLV mode of operation created two major side effects on the CD’s usability as a computer data device at higher operating speeds.   The first is the susceptibility to vibration of the CD at the high spin speeds.  The second is the difficulty in attaining high speed random access performance.  When data readback is sequential, as on an audio CD, the head tracks the optical &quot;groove&quot; on the CD and the spin speed gradually changes depending upon head position.  For random accesses of computer data, however, the disc spin speed must quickly accelerate and decelerate as the head seeks to different areas of the disc.  This leads to the whirring sounds you may notice on your CD drive as the spin speed changes rapidly, and lengthens random access seek times.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For random access of data, the target value for seek time is under 250 ms.  Within that 250 ms the pickup head must move to the correct track and begin reading data, and the CD spin speed must accelerate or decelerate to the proper RPM.  Moving the head in that time is easy; getting the CD to change speed that quickly is not.  Under rapid acceleration or deceleration the disc tends to slip in the clamping mechanism, and the higher spin speeds require more powerful and power-hungry motors to accelerate the mass of the disc rapidly.   To avoid the extremes of high power motors, the designers enhanced the data read channel electronics to allow detection of data even if the disc is not yet spinning at the proper speed, allowing a longer time for the disc to reach optimum speed.  Thus the evolving designs struggled to balance motor power and heat dissipation with the ability to enhance the read channel for a wider &quot;data capture range&quot;. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When speeds began to push beyond 8X, the designers could no longer overcome the problems associated with the increased RPM, and had to resort to fundamental changes in the readback method to attain the higher &quot;X&quot; numbers.  These changes caused a shift in what &quot;X&quot; means and in how performance of a CDROM drive is measured.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P>Beyond 8X - The Design Rules Change</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Beyond 8X, the drive designers ran into the barriers of maximum spin speed and lengthening random access times.  In the 8X drive, the spin speed varies from a low of 1600 RPM when the pickup head is at the outer diameter, to a high of 4240 RPM when the head is at the inner diameter.  To move to 12X, these speeds scale up to 2400 RPM at the outer diameter and 6360 RPM at the inner diameter.  Some manufacturers were able to overcome the vibration and disc acceleration issues at these higher spin speeds and produce 12X CLV drives using the standard CD design methodology.  Others chose to limit the maximum RPM to less than 6360 RPM, but modify the speed control method so that they could provide a 12X transfer rate over a portion of the CD surface, and thereby still claim &quot;12X&quot; performance.  To do this they used methods referred to as CAV (Constant Angular Velocity), or. P-CLV (Partial Constant Linear Velocity), or CLV/CAV (Constant Linear Velocity/Constant Angular Velocity).   </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To illustrate the different speed control methods and their effects on the transfer rate, refer to the figures below.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Figure 1 shows how the spin speed changes as the head moves from inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) for a typical 8X CLV drive.  Note that the data transfer rate remains constant at 1200 kBytes/sec over the whole data surface of the CD.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Figure 2 shows a &quot;12X&quot; drive that limits the maximum spin speed to the same as that used for the 8X drive, but follows the normal CLV speed curve for 12X for the rest of the CD surface.  (The dashed line represents the speed curve used in a &quot;normal&quot; 12X CLV drive.)  The result is that the data transfer rate is no longer constant over all of the CD surface, but varies as shown in the bottom of Figure 2.  At the ID, the effective data rate is the same as an 8X drive (1200 kBytes/sec).  As the head moves out from the ID, the transfer rate increases until it reaches 12X (1800 kBytes/sec), and  then remains at 12X for the rest of the CD surface.  In this example, the portion of the CD surface, and therefore data capacity, that experiences the variable data rate from 8X to 12X, represents about 15% of the CD capacity, or about 100 MB.  The remaining 540 MB of the CD surface experiences the constant 12X transfer rate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Similar curves could be drawn for 8 -16X or 12 -16X or 12 -24X drives, but the basic scheme remains the same, with the underlying objectives of limiting the peak spin speed and reducing the spin speed range.  Carried to its limit as transfer speeds increase, the drive becomes entirely a CAV drive with a constant RPM of 4240 RPM over the whole disc surface.   For that drive, the data rate is constantly varying as the head moves out from ID to OD, leading to a data transfer rate range of 8X - 21X.  Manufacturers that can achieve a 6360 RPM spin rate can provide a 12X - 32X CAV drive. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P>What Does All This Mean to the End User? </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Through the 8X speed range, the CDROM drives have been described and marketed by their &quot;X&quot; number, the higher the better.  Beyond 8X, the tendency is to market the drive by its highest transfer rate designation, without bothering to mention that the number is a peak transfer rate, not sustainable over the entire disc contents as before.  The typical user may not notice the difference.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Benchmark results are often used to influence buying decisions.  Benchmarks that exist today tend to measure performance in one of two ways: distribute the tested sectors evenly over the entire surface of the disc, or select sectors in the middle of the disc for test purposes.  Both of these test methods produce benchmark numbers on 8X - 12X or 12X - 16X drives that reflect the higher number in the speed range; i.e., 12X for the 8 -12X drive and 16X for the 12 -16X drive.  Benchmarks can and might be written, however, that expose the lower speed portions of the drive, and if these are highlighted in product reviews, could lead to bad marks for some of the CLV/CAV products as compared to CLV drives.   As drive speeds evolve however, all of the manufacturers will have to move from CLV to the CLV/CAV technology and the market will eventually become used to the shift in meaning of the &quot;X&quot; numbers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regardless of benchmark numbers, in actual usage most CD software applications are written to run on the most commonly available drive speeds, and are generally written to perform adequately on a range of drives.  The common base today is a 2X or 4X drive.  Running an application on a faster drive will lead to faster installations and images popping up faster on the screen, but will not appreciably affect usability of the application or the level of user satisfaction. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However, there is an opposing factor that could slow the operation of some applications on the CLV/CAV drives.  The slow transfer rate portion of the CLV/CAV drive is at the ID of the disc. It turns out that data on a CD is recorded starting at the ID and moving toward the OD; thus the directory structure and many of the frequently used routines and data could well end up near the ID in the slow region of the disc.  If the application were written to run acceptably on a 4X drive, then this distinction would have no practical effect.  However, if the application were designed to run on a 12X drive, then a 12X CLV drive might actually have an advantage over a CLV/CAV drive with a speed range of 8 -16X.   In the consumer market where bigger numbers win, this distinction would be impossible to get across, but to a business customer this could be a selling point for 12X CLV.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Another factor that favors a 12X, 8X,  or even 4X CLV drive over the 8 -16X or 12 -16X CLV/CAV drive is system CPU utilization.   Most CDROM drives today are configured for programmed I/O transfers on the IDE/ATAPI interface and tend to consume a lot of CPU bandwidth.  OEM Magazine, in the December 1996 issue, showed test results from a range of 8X to 12X drives running at speeds from 2X to 12X.  CPU utilization at a 2X transfer rate was in the 8 -13% range.  However, at 4X this reached 15 - 25%, at 8X it increased to 28 - 49% and at 12X reached 71%.   Utilization this high could interfere with the quality of game play, especially video playback, and would be an overall handicap since applications rarely need more than a 4X drive speed for proper operation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the CLV/CAV drive’s favor however, is the lower seek access time resulting from the narrower disc spin speed range.  For frequent random file accesses of small files, these drives will perform better than the CLV drives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In summary, over the next six months or so during the transition period from CLV to CLV/CAV, the user community will need to be educated about the change in the meaning of the speed ratings on CDROM drives.  For the consumer market, a specification of the drives as 8 - 16X, 12 -16X, etc., rather than simply 16X, may be enough since the real effect on the performance of application software will be minimal.  For the business user who benchmarks systems before buying, however, a more detailed explanation of the performance subtleties will likely be necessary. </P>
