IRVINE, Calif. -- August 5, 1996 -- Radically lowering the cost
of computing while delivering businesses an innovative computing
solution, AST Computer (ASTA--NASDAQ) today introduced Centralan,
the only Windows-based multi-user thin-client system.  A unique
combination of hardware and software, Centralan allows up to sixteen
users to efficiently share Pentium processing power by eliminating
the need and cost of a separate CPU at each desk.  Ideal for small
businesses as well as departments or branch offices of larger
businesses, Centralan lowers the cost of computing by reducing
the initial computing investment and limiting support, maintenance
and upgrade costs to only one system.  Additional users can be
added to the initial base system for as little as $500.
<P>
 &quot;Anyone installing a network today expects to pay at least
$5,000 for a server,&quot; commented Dan Sheppard, vice president
of worldwide product marketing for AST.  &quot;AST's unique use
of thin-client technology allows users to be added for around
$500 each, as opposed to $1,500 for a complete PC!&quot;
<P>

<BR>
AST's Centralan system features a single 166MHz Intel Pentium
processor and serves up to 16 users.  Each user only needs a keyboard,
mouse and monitor at their desks, significantly reducing hardware
costs.  In addition to the initial investment being lower, the
overall cost of ownership is also reduced by limiting support
and upgrade expenses to only one system.  Users can also expect
top performance and functionality with Centralan, because it works
without the system drain and compromise of using a shared PC as
a file server, like that found in a peer-to-peer network.
<P>
Designed to simplify network computing, Centralan is easy to
install and support.  It's virtually a plug-and-play system that
can be installed in less than an hour.  Centralan's four user-base
system comes pre-installed with a LAN-ready Intel&#174; EtherExpress&#153;
10/100B network adapter and a high-performance 33.6Kbps modem
to suit all connectivity requirements.  Because Centralan includes
local area network functionality, users can share files and printers
as well as running multi-user applications.
<P>
<U><B>Unique Smart Remote Access</B></U>
<BR>
To make remote access easy and fast, Centralan comes with integrated
remote access capabilities.  With a separate PC, remote users
can access their data and run applications the same way they would
while in their office.  For on-the-spot technical support and
problem resolution or to handle system administration tasks, authorized
users can dial-up the system from anywhere.  Security is maintained
through multi-level password protection and a dial-back user verification.
Also for ease-of-use, AST authorized resellers can offer remote
site management services to their customers.
<P>
<U><B>One System, Many Applications</B></U>
<BR>
Because Centralan makes one PC act like a whole team of PCs,
it is ideal for a variety of businesses and applications.  Small
businesses, departments and branch offices of larger businesses
can benefit from the multi-user environment and take advantage
of Centralan's remote access and connectivity features.  Immediate
access to the corporate-wide network is simple and easy.  
<P>
For businesses that do not have systems experts on staff, AST
designed Centralan so that it is easy to install and support.
Centralan is also the perfect solution for areas of education
or business where every student or person does not need a computer
of their own, just the ability to access and utilize one.
<P>
&quot;Another benefit of Centralan is that it can breathe new
life into older PCs,&quot; explained Sheppard.  &quot;Monitors,
keyboards and even older CPUs can be used in conjunction with
Centralan, providing another reason why Centralan is so cost-effective.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Here Today, Here Tomorrow</B></U>
<BR>
Unlike traditional systems that can often become obsolete within
a matter of months, Centralan's unique architecture allows the
latest technologies to be easily and economically integrated.
&quot;As faster, more powerful processors come to market, each
user on the Centralan system can benefit in a cost-effective way,&quot;
explained Sheppard.  &quot;With only one system to upgrade to
next-generation technologies, the Centralan will be in offices
for years to come.&quot; 
<P>
<U><B>Maximum Performance Without Compromise</B></U> 
<BR>
Centralan's pre-configured hardware includes a 166MHz Intel Pentium
processor, 32MB EDO memory expandable to 192MB, multi-VGA adapter,
2GB Fast/Wide SCSI-2 drive, an 8X IDE CD-ROM, three internal and
four external drive bays, two 32-bit PCI and five 16-bit ISA expansion
slots, a 33.6Kbps modem and an Intel&#174; EtherExpress&#153;
10/100 Mbps PCI card.  Monitors are sold separately.
<P>
&quot;We've combined the best in hardware and software to provide
an uncompromised alternative to network computing,&quot; explained
Sheppard.  &quot;This new solution presents a radical change in
PC architecture, taking enormous strides in microprocessor computing
power.  The unique technology in this product allows several users
to share the computing power of a Pentium processor, all at a
very competitive price point.&quot;
<P>
