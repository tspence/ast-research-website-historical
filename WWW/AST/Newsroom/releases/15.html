<B>AST COMPUTER'S NEW ENTREPRENEURIAL EDGE PROGRAM HELPS<BR>
SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES KEEP PACE WITH LARGER COMPANIES</B><BR>
</center>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., July 28, 1997 &#150; For small to mid-sized companies, accurately answering questions such as &#39;How does technology allow me to stay competitive?,&#39; &#39;How can I avoid technology obsolescence?,&#39; and &#39;How do I keep current on technology trends and know I'm receiving the most value for my technology purchases?&#39; are critical to surviving against larger competitors in today's fast-paced markets.<BR>
<P>
Towards meeting these needs, AST Computer today announced a unique program that enables owners and managers at small to mid-sized companies to keep informed about the latest business trends, technologies and operational practices.<BR>
<P>
Called Entrepreneurial Edge(, the new program is designed to help users quickly receive the benefits that the latest PC technology promises.  It was developed following extensive research into the needs and challenges facing small and mid-sized businesses.<BR>
<P>
&#34;Entrepreneurial Edge helps our customers leverage their limited resources to keep technologically on-par with the best of larger companies,&#34; said Dan Sheppard, AST vice president, global corporate marketing.  &#34;It helps demonstrate AST's high level of responsiveness and dedication to deliver value and work harder for our customers' business.  It also is the first program we have developed to support our new focus on marketing primarily to business users at small to medium-sized companies.&#34;<BR>
<P>
Entrepreneurial Edge consists of three program elements which uniquely inform how to implement efficient and effective technology and business solutions, including:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>A toll-free hotline staffed by PC technology experts who can provide useful, hard-to-find information about a host of technology issues, such as networking, the Internet and applications software.  The Entrepreneurial Edge hotline can be reached at &#40;888&#41; 367-3493 and is staffed from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. &#40;PDT&#41; , five days per week.
<LI>A workshop series tailored to the needs of small and mid-sized business.  The workshops are complemented by a series of informative 'white paper' articles that support the presented information.
<LI>A separate section of the AST Web site which owners and managers at small and mid-sized businesses will find technical tips and other related information on running a company.  Located at www.ast.com, the Entrepreneurial Edge Web page also features case studies about key business issues, as well as a forum to receive quick answers related to technology and other business issues.
</ul>
<P>
Participants' response for the Entrepreneurial Edge workshop series has been extremely positive, including:<BR>
<ul>
<LI>&#34;AST provided a powerful and effective day that will directly benefit our business, with no sales hook,&#34; said David Rosenthal, managing director, Curtis-Rosenthal, LLC, a Los Angeles-based real estate appraisal firm.
<LI>&#34;The financial services industry is ever changing and the competition level is at an all-time high.  I believe AST's workshop has given me a clearer perspective on how to add more value to my business and has allowed me to really think about the services I provide,&#34; said Joe Haywood, partner, AFP Group, a Los Angeles-based financial services company.
</ul>
<P>
AST's goal is for Entrepreneurial Edge to help more than 15,000 small to mid-sized businesses in Southern California over the next few months.  Soon thereafter, plans call for the program to be expanded to other regions in the U.S.<BR>
