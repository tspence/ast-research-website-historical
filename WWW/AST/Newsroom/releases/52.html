IRVINE, Calif., June 17, 1996 -- Flexing its hardware muscle as
it continues to reinforce its first-to-market strategy, AST Computer
today announced it is now taking orders for its next generation
of Pentium Pro processor-based Bravo commercial desktop minitowers,
designated Bravo MS-T 6180 and 6200.
<P>
Positioned as the new standard in power performance for mainstream
business applications, this latest crop of Bravo minitowers provides
users with the headroom necessary for environments of today and
tomorrow.
<P>
&quot;Let's take a Pentium Pro processor-based 180MHz system
and compare it to today's Pentium processor-based 166MHz system,&quot;
said AST's Laura Raybin, director, commercial desktop marketing.
&quot;Now, let's assume that both systems are equivalently configured
and are running Microsoft Windows&#174; 95.  The Pentium Pro 180MHz processor-based system will
run as much as 64 percent faster than the Pentium 166MHz processor-based
system - at a slight cost incremental of about ten percent!&quot;
<P>
Combining the latest in Intel processor technology, with its
best-of-breed Bravo minitowers, AST is enabling business users
to supercharge their business applications today while providing
them a technology for tomorrow.
<P>
The new Bravo minitowers pack a powerful punch with Intel's fastest
Pentium Pro 180- and 200MHz processor engines and Intel's 440FX PCIset letting users
take advantage of today's hardware advances.
<P>
The latest Bravo Pentium Pro processor-based systems bundle Microsoft&#174;
Windows NT Workstation 3.51 for today's demanding and data-intensive
32-bit applications.  Preloaded with Windows NT Workstation 3.51,
the latest systems come bundled with a coupon good for a free
upgrade to Windows NT 4.0, expected to be available by the end
of the summer.
<P>
&quot;We are pleased to see AST, with these latest Bravo PCs,
provide the power, security and reliability to allow Windows NT
Workstation to deliver maximum performance to business customers,&quot;
said Jonathan Roberts, Microsoft director of product marketing,
Desktop and Business Systems Division.
<P>
<U><B>Meeting Corporate Needs Head-On</B></U>
<BR>
AST has designed its Bravo MS-T 6180 and 6200 desktops to take
advantage of 32-bit applications, and to address the needs of
corporate users looking to make the transition to Windows NT Workstation
and Pentium Pro processor technology.  
<P>
According to research house Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII),
Pentium Pro technology combined with Windows NT will make full
use of 32-bit codes and applications.  Deployment of the technology
will begin to rapidly grow in the second half of 1996.
<P>
&quot;We are primed to take advantage of this powerful combination
of Pentium Pro technology with Windows NT and are right now providing
our end-users and resellers with the best in cutting-edge technology
- giving them an advantage over their competition,&quot; said
Raybin.  &quot;You could say that we are allowing our customers
to have their cake - and eat it too!&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Performance For Data-Intensive Environments</B></U>
<br>
The Bravo MS-T 6180 and MS-T 6200 represent some of AST's most
advanced business desktops and are designed for use in performance-intensive
environments, including financial, statistical and scientific
applications.  With aggressive street pricing ranging from $2,650
to $3,300, the latest Bravo PCs are leading the way in price performance
in the technically advanced business desktop arena.
<P>
 &quot;With these new Bravo Pentium Pro processor-based systems,
AST is continuing its commitment to the latest technology at truly
aggressive prices,&quot; stated Intel's Kea Grilley, director,
Business Desktop Marketing.   &quot;Combining the latest in Intel
core logic and processor technologies with AST's innovative hardware
and software solutions gives users highly competitive performance.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>A New Level of Desktop Scalability</B></U>
<BR>
AST has incorporated the new Intel 440FX PCIset into its newest
Bravo personal computers, further pushing the limits of PC performance
by bringing a new level of scalability to the desktop. 
<P>
&quot;Our customers are migrating to 32-bit software environments
such as Windows NT Workstation for higher performance and greater
network control and manageability,&quot; Raybin noted.  &quot;Commercial
users are hungry for maximum performance and features such as
increased bandwidth, improved video and audio performance, as
well as disk system throughput; Intel's 440FX PCIset helps deliver
this performance.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>AST-IntraAccess - Sharing Made Easy</B></U>
<BR>
Effective information sharing is becoming the next revolution
in business tools.  Staying on the leading-edge of information

the Internet Factory's Communication<I> </I>Builder, critically
acclaimed software that provides the Windows NT and Windows&#174; 95
Internet and Intranet Web server for business and enterprise computing.
 Authoring Web Internet/Intranet pages is painless with SoftQuad's
HoTMetaL Light&#153; authoring tool, helping users to be creative and
get their message out in new and clever ways.
<P>
Surfing the Internet for the latest stock information and technology
trend watching is quick and hassle-free with Netscape's Navigator&#153;,

<U><B>Paving The Way</B></U>
<BR>
In addition to providing a painless and streamlined upgrade
path for its Windows NT users, AST is moving beyond the competition

you can get a real-time listing of all systems for example, that
currently have only 8MB of RAM, and which version of Microsoft
Windows is installed - and simplify your life in a matter of minutes,&quot;
