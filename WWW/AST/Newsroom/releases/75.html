IRVINE, Calif., March 5, 1996 -- Continuing to pursue innovative and leading-edge technology solutions, AST Computer today announced its plans for support of Intel's major architecture enhancement, designated MMX&#153; technology, that is designed to provide fast, powerful and cost-effective multimedia solutions for use in a host of applications.
<P>
MMX, the next generation Intel architecture, incorporates new instructions and datatypes to accelerate multimedia and communication applications for faster graphics, faster video, faster picture processing and faster music synthesis.  
<P>
&quot;AST is proud to announce its support and commitment to Intel's new MMX technology,&quot; said Ian Diery, AST's president and chief executive officer.  &quot;We believe that this technology is great news for future developments of advanced multimedia systems.  Combining AST's expertise in process design with the most significant
addition to the Intel Architecture instruction set since the Intel386&#153; processor, reinforces AST's efforts to partner with industry champions and deliver leading-edge technology solutions to our customers.&quot;
<P>
AST believes that MMX technology will be embraced by graphics, audio and modem vendors.  It is expected to provide a strong source of computing power for new communication and multimedia applications and will also provide better system price performance.
<P>
AST plans to target several areas for MMX technology including video conferencing, MPEG 2 video and DSVD speech compression.

The use of MMX technology reinforces AST's strategy of being quick-to-market with leading-edge technology.  In January of this year, AST was the first PC manufacturer to begin volume shipments of Intel Pentium&reg; Pro processor-based systems to the indirect channel.
