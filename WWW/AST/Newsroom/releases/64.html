IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 5, 1995 -- Representing a key strategy designed
to increase performance in accord with its turnaround plan, AST
Research (ASTA-NASDAQ) today announced it is the first manufacturer
to deliver systems to the indirect sales channel incorporating
the latest PC-based technologies from Intel and other manufacturers.
<P>
 AST today became the first manufacturer to ship desktop systems
in volume to computer resellers based on Intel's Pentium&#174;
Pro microprocessor, the most advanced computing engine available
to date.  In addition, AST is shipping one of the industry's most
advanced remote diagnostics products, AST-LifeLine, that enables
quicker technical support responses at lower costs for its Bravo
and Premmia business desktop systems.
<P>
&quot;Quick to market and AST will become synonymous, interchangeable
terms,&quot; said Ian Diery, AST president and chief executive
officer.  &quot;In addition to being the cornerstone of our turnaround
plan, delivering leading-edge technologies in advance of our competitors
strengthens our commitment to the indirect channel and enables
our resellers to provide a competitive response to Compaq and
IBM, as well as direct marketers like Dell and Gateway.&quot;
<P>
Bravo minitower systems based on Intel's Pentium Pro processor
and Microsoft's 32-bit Windows NT&#153; operating system incorporate
leading edge technologies and are well suited for processing-intensive
environments including CAD, graphics, financial and statistical
applications.  Incorporating the Intel Pentium Pro processor into
AST's Bravo line extends the award-winning line of AST products
to support the complete range of currently-available Pentium and
Pentium Pro processor platforms from Intel and results in an optimum
solution for business users looking to maximize their PC investment.

The Bravo MS-T 6150 is one of AST's most advanced business desktop
systems.  Its aggressive street price of $4,300 enables it to
be a viable, cost-effective alternative to implement many tasks
traditionally performed on more costly systems.  It offers a high
level of expandability with five drive bays -- two internal 3.5-inch
and three external 5.25-inch -- along with four 32-bit PCI slots
and three 16-bit ISA slots.  Other features include:
<UL>
<LI>Enhanced performance from a 150 MHz Pentium Pro processor
<LI>Robust storage from hard drives up to 1.6 GB
<LI>Fast data access with 16 MB of memory, expandable to 128 MB
with 256 KB secondary cache
<LI>Quick graphics and vibrant color from a PCI-based 64-bit ATI
graphics controller with 2 MB of video RAM, expandable to 4 MB 
<LI>Realistic stereo sound from 16-bit SoundBlaster&#174;-compatible audio

AST LifeLine is an interactive technical support system that
delivers the ultimate in customer support by significantly reducing
the time and costs associated with resolving technical issues.
It allows remote diagnosis and repair of business system problems
by simultaneously exchanging voice and data over an ordinary phone
line.  AST PC technicians, as well as resellers, can use AST LifeLine
to look at the user's system files and configurations in real
time, while also discussing the issues surrounding the problem.
 This integrated approach enables quick fixes for many problems
-- often in a single phone call.
<P>
&quot;Products like AST LifeLine provide our customers with quick
solutions to critical problems, and our new systems equipped with
the latest technology provide strategic platforms for increased
performance,&quot; added Diery.
