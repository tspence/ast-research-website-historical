<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">IRVINE, CALIF., May 27, 1997 - Providing
a cure to high PC support costs is something that users have come
to expect from AST&reg; Computer.   And selected new Bravo commercial
systems from AST Computer do just that.  AST's new Bravo MS commercial
desktops will come preloaded with Intel LANDesk<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
Client Manager 3.0 software.  Merging the best of AST software
innovation with the best of Intel hardware know-how has created
an optimal business solution from which entrepreneurs and Fortune
500 users alike can benefit.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;By combining Bravo's leading-edge
technology with enhanced desktop management capabilities from
Intel's LANDesk, AST is helping to alleviate the headaches associated
with the high costs of computing,&quot; stated Laura Raybin, director,
brand marketing, AST Computer.  &quot;Small, medium and large
business users alike can look forward to a heightened level of
productivity, cost-effectiveness and manageability with the Bravo
line of commercial desktops.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> AST's use of LANDesk product technology

to further reduce the costs of business computing without sacrificing
the benefits of high-performance PC computing.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Intel's LANDesk Client Manager software
is Desktop Management Interface (DMI) compliant and enhances the
management capabilities of PCs, thereby reducing the total cost
of ownership associated with business computing.  With greater
ease of management through LANDesk Client Manager on AST's new
Bravo systems, problems can be proactively handled to reduce system
downtime and decrease the expense of labor associated with system/network
management and support.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Times New Roman">LANDesk Client Manager
3.0 manages all aspects of the computer to LAN connection, providing
the user with the ability to achieve greater functionality and
productivity.  Specifically, the self-diagnostic capabilities
maintain real-time PC health by predicting potential problems
and component failure.  LANDesk alerts users prior to failure,
resulting in greatly reduced computer downtime and service needs.
 Ultimately, this improves employee productivity and reduces the
need for costly support from either the IS staff or component/system
vendor.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Critical desktop information is never
more than a keystroke away with Bravo computers through LANDesk
Client Manager.  IS departments can easily service and track PC
and network assets any time of day through the administrator and
remote access functions.  Plus, client installation and computer
upgrades can be simplified with LANDesk's integration onto AST's
Bravo systems.  </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;With its new Bravo MS computers,
AST is offering valuable management capabilities to help businesses
further reduce their computing costs,&quot; said Ed Ekstrom, vice
president of Intel's Internet and Communications Group and general
manager of the System Management Division.  &quot;These powerful
Bravo systems with LANDesk Client Manager are a fine example of
how business PCs can provide greater functionality and manageability
for increased IS productivity, while simultaneously minimizing
the amount of IS support required.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">AST designed the Bravo systems with
full network compatibility in mind.  Through LANDesk Client Manager,
the Bravo systems provide compatibility with leading connections
to the LAN, enterprise management functions and network operating
systems.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The new Bravo systems with Intel's
LANDesk Client Manager 3.0 is scheduled to begin shipping in May.</FONT>
