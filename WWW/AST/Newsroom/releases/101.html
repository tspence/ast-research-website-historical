<B>AST OFFERS CUSTOMERS FUTURE-READY PRODUCTS TO MEET THE YEAR
2000 TRANSITION</B>
<P>
<B>Latest AST Servers, Commercial Desktops and Mobile PCs Recognize
and Register Coming Millennium</B>

<P>
IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 3, 1996 -- Recognizing that the turn of
the century poses significant challenges for the information technology
industry, AST Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA) today announced that its
line of commercial desktops, servers and notebooks are equipped
to deal with the onset of the year 2000.  All Bravo commercial
desktops introduced after April 1996, Manhattan S6200 and Manhattan
CommercePRO servers introduced after July 1996, and notebook PCs
introduced after May 1, 1996 are next century-compliant.
<P>
&quot;We believe that a large percentage of businesses today
are taking a 'wait and see' attitude and have not yet begun to
address the technological issues of what a move to the next century
really means,&quot; said Dan Sheppard, vice president, worldwide
product marketing.  &quot;The year 2000 is real and we are committed
to providing technology solutions that address the challenges
users face as they move into the next millennium.&quot;

<B>Moving Into the Next Century</B>
<BR>
&quot;In the 1960's and 70's computers were living-room size,
however, they had very little storage space.   Rather than waste
valuable and costly space, engineers programmed the computers
not to store the first two digits of the year,&quot; said Sheppard.
 &quot;This means that when the next millennium arrives, the internal
clocks of mainframes and other computing devices will change from
12/31/99 to 1/1/00, meaning that systems will not be able to distinguish
between the year 1900 and 2000 -- potentially throwing systems
into chaos.&quot;
<P>
AST however, has designed its current PC lineup to handle the
year 2000 smoothly and  efficiently.  AST is actively replacing
two-digit date fields, which cannot distinguish between the years
1900 and 2000, with four-digit fields by incorporating a four-digit
year date code into the BIOS of its systems.
<P>
AST recognizes that at risk for the year 2000 are proprietary
applications, in which developers created their own date-related
code instead of using the year 2000 compliant date set supplied
by vendors.
<P>
&quot;Imagine that your insurance policy is up for renewal in
the year 2001,&quot; noted  Sheppard. &quot;If there is an error
in the program due to a spreadsheet macro unable to issue a forecast
beyond 2000, then a faulty program might recognize the last two
digits of the year as 1901 and throw the policy out.&quot;
<P>
