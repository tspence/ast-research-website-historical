IRVINE, Calif., April 21, 1997 -- AST Research, Inc.(ASTA--NASDAQ) today announced that financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 were lower than anticipated.  The company's revenues were approximately $347 million and its net loss was approximately 
$110 million ($1.90 per share) for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997, ended March 29.  These results compare with revenues of $530.0 million and a loss of $115.8 million 
($2.59 loss per share) during the comparable prior year period.<BR>

In response to these financial results, AST announced plans for a reduction of approximately 25 percent of its work force worldwide.  This action is expected to result in a charge of approximately $12 million during the second fiscal quarter.<BR>

"Our turnaround efforts require more aggressive actions than in the past due to lower than anticipated performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 1997," said Mr. Y.S. Kim, AST president and chief executive officer.  "Reducing our global workforce will allow the company to significantly lower operating costs, which, combined with our continuing product development and demand generation efforts, will help to further advance our goal to return to profitability."<BR>
<P>
The company previously reported that net sales and operating losses for the first quarter would be negatively impacted due to lower demand, including an accelerated competitive pricing environment, a product transition period in its commercial desktop and notebook product lines and customer uncertainty surrounding a proposal with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. to commence negotiations to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AST not currently owned by Samsung or its affiliates.  On April 15, 1997, AST and Samsung announced they had reached a definitive merger agreement, under which Samsung will commence a tender offer to acquire all of AST's outstanding shares not currently owned by Samsung or its affiliates at a price of $5.40 per share in cash.  The tender offer will be commenced April 21, 1997 and will expire at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 19, 1997, unless extended.<BR>
