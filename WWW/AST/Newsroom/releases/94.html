<B>AST REPAYS $90 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE TO TANDY CORP.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif. (July 12, 1996) -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA--NASDAQ)
today announced that it has completed its previously-disclosed
plans to repay a $90 million three-year promissory note due to
Tandy Corporation related to the 1993 acquisition of Tandy Corporation's
personal computer manufacturing operations.
<P>
Under terms of the repayment, AST provided Tandy with $30 million
in newly-issued AST stock, representing approximately 4.5 million
shares, along with $60 million in cash.  Cash paid to Tandy was
advanced this week to AST by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. as
part of a 1995 Letter of Credit Agreement between AST and Samsung
which resulted in Samsung receiving approximately 8.5 million
shares of newly-issued AST stock.  This increases Samsung's stock
ownership to 26.4 million shares (including those held by Samsung's
U.S. subsidiary), representing approximately 46 percent of AST's
total outstanding shares.
<P>
The total amount of newly-issued AST stock delivered to both
Samsung and Tandy yesterday was approximately 13.0 million shares,
representing approximately 23 percent of AST's total outstanding
shares after all the shares were issued.
<P>
Samsung also holds options for 4.4 million shares of stock that
were issued in connection with a Dec. 1995 support agreement.
If these options were now exercised, Samsung's ownership position
today would increase to approximately 49.6 percent.
