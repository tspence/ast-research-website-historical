<P>IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 17, 1997 – With personal computers now serving as the central nerve systems for businesses around the world, managing the system administration and operating expense for those PCs has become a critical challenge for IS managers and business owners. In fact, the Gartner Group estimates that companies spend as much as three to four times the initial system acquisition cost annually to service, support, and maintain all PCs.</P>
<P>Committed to providing PC solutions for the commercial market, AST</FONT><SUP>&reg;</SUP><FONT SIZE=2> Computer today at COMDEX unveiled its integrated, standards-based approach to systems and networks management.</P>
</FONT><P>AST’s Universal Manageability Solution<SUP>SM</SUP> (UMS<SUP>SM</SUP>) helps simplify system administration and reduce total operating costs by providing a solid foundation to better manage assets and optimize efficiencies.</P>
<P>"AST intends to deliver greater manageability to its customers via the Intel Wired for Management initiative," said Will Swope, vice president of business desktops in the Desktop Products Group, Intel Corporation. "AST is adopting the widely supported Wired for Management capabilities in its desktop, server and mobile systems, combining manageability features with the Intel LANDesk<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Configuration Manager in order to let IS managers achieve greater control in the enterprise."</P>

<P>"By closely working with our customers and listening to the challenges they face, we have developed what we believe is one of the most robust and comprehensive productivity solutions available today. AST’s Universal Manageability Solution builds upon some basic tenets of the IS world – flexibility, simplicity and seamless integration," explained Terry J. Baker, AST’s director of Worldwide Product Planning. "So whether an IS manager needs to know how many PCs they have and where they are, what hardware they contain and how they are configured, or what software programs and versions are on them, they can now get this information quickly and easily with our UMS."</P>
<B><U><P>IS Managers Save Time and Money</P>
</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>UMS enables IS managers to automate time-consuming, repetitive tasks they used to perform manually – such as asset tracking, user setup and configuration, and remote software distribution – which in turn saves them both time and money by increasing their efficiency and productivity. UMS is designed to help IS managers optimize the functionality of the equipment they already have, delivering higher PC uptime and faster problem resolution so that companies can concentrate on running their business – not their computers.</P>
<P>The development of UMS was a natural progression for AST, which already offers some of the most manageable servers and desktops available. The new AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Servers and Bravo desktop computers have been designed with manageability in mind. The company’s next generation of Ascentia&trade; notebooks will also have manageability functions incorporated into the design.</P>
<P>Some of these manageability features enabled by UMS include centralized asset management via remote consoles for greater operating efficiency; easier upgrading of operating systems and application software, increasing productivity; system analysis and problem diagnosis to reduce downtime; improved help-desk support for end-users, minimizing the cost of service; enhanced security across the entire enterprise; and off-hour system maintenance.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">- more -</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In addition to AST’s built-in manageability, UMS incorporates a number of leading-brand manageability and industry-standard protocols, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI>DMI &amp; SNMP – Desktop Management Interface (DMI), which is available on all Bravo desktops and the next generation of Ascentia notebooks, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is available on AST Premium Servers, provides access to hundreds of key system attributes through a simple graphical user interface. Developed to make network management simpler and less expensive, these standards are widely supported by most major vendors of PCs, operating systems, and management applications.</LI>
<LI>Intel’s LANDesk Client &amp; Server Manager – This powerful management package, based on DMI and SNMP, is available with all AST desktops, servers, and next-generation notebooks. It enables users to gather much of the information on DMI- and SNMP-enabled systems and manage them locally or remotely. These applications – LANDesk Client Manager for desktops and notebooks and LANDesk Server Manager for servers – also integrate easily into many other enterprise management suites because they are based on industry standards.</LI>
<LI>Intel’s Wired for Management – Bravo desktops and future Ascentia notebooks are highly instrumented and compliant with this new initiative, which provides a solid hardware foundation for managing systems. Using Intel’s LANDesk Configuration Manager and similar software applications, system administrators can remotely wake-up and service PCs during off-hours, minimizing employee downtime.</LI></UL>
<DIR>

</FONT><P>Other features include Service Boot, which enable the administrator to boot a client and connect them directly to a DHCP-compliant (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, even if the client’s hard drive is unformatted. Once connected, the server can load an operating system and applications directly to the client.</P></DIR>

<P>In addition, UMS’s combination of highly integrated and instrumented platforms and LANDesk software products provides predictive failure analysis and event alerting capabilities directly to the client and/or centralized IS management console. This enables the user to proactively diagnose and solve potential problems before they ever occur, reducing potential downtime and increasing overall productivity.</P>

<P>When We Say Universal, We Mean It</P>
</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Because UMS is based on open industry standards, it will work not only with AST servers, desktops, notebooks, and peripherals, but also with hardware from most other manufacturers. UMS is not necessarily designed to force end-users to use all AST systems. The object is to provide highly manageable platforms that can be taken as a complete AST solution or can be easily integrated into existing networked environments.</P>
<P>IS managers can also use a variety of third-party management applications – such as those from Intel, Microsoft, Computer Associates, HP, IBM, McAfee, Symantec, and others. UMS offers simple integration into these applications, allowing users to perform a complete spectrum of management tasks using a common framework.</P>
<P>The fact that AST chose COMDEX 1997 to introduce its UMS is no coincidence. AST and Samsung have joined forces to create one of the largest exhibits displayed at this year’s COMDEX, and the theme of their 15,000 sq. ft. booth pavilion – #L1248/1647 – is "Building A Better Future Together." The key to a better future for AST and Samsung lies in providing solutions like UMS that will ensure customers a better, more productive and profitable future.</P>
<P>In addition to UMS, the exhibit will include the fault tolerance features of the new AST Premium Server line, the security features and Trillion Technology&trade; that make the Ascentia M series of notebook computers the smartest mobile computing solution in the market, and the manageability and ease-of-use features that make the Bravo commercial desktops so popular. AST will also introduce its new Ovation! reseller program, providing additional support to the channel at a time when many vendors are reducing their support.</P>
