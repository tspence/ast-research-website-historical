IRVINE, Calif., January 8, 1996 -- Spiraling technical service to new 
heights, AST Computer today announced the availability of AST-LifeLine 
support for its business desktop users. Conveniently packaged as an 
option kit for its AST&#174 Bravo and Premmia systems, AST-LifeLine 
delivers the ultimate in customer support through the use of VoiceView 
TALK SHOP from Radish Communications Systems, Inc. An integrated voice 
and data protocol, VoiceView TALK SHOP allows for remote diagnosis and 
repair of business system problems.
<P>
Using an ordinary phone line, voice and data communications can be 
exchanged between the business customer and PC support technician to 
quickly evaluate the situation and implement a &quot;real time&quot;
solution or &quot;fix,&quot; often during a single call.
<P>
&quot;AST-LifeLine is a superior customer support solution for business 
users,&quot; said Laura Raybin, director of business desktop marketing 
for AST. &quot;Users are looking to adopt cutting-edge technology to 
gain a competitive edge over rivals. AST-LifeLine provides users that 
edge through dynamic, interactive, real-time customer support that in 
effect reduces the amount of time needed to resolve technical 
problems,&quot; she added. AST-LifeLine is an interactive technical 
support system that provides a new and comprehensive standard for 
business desktop service. By allowing help desk personnel to remotely 
gather technical information and configuration details in real time, 
AST-LifeLine helps reduce overall expenses associated with technical 
service and support.
<P>
AST-LifeLine incorporates Radish Communications System's VoiceView
integrated voice and data protocol with custom AST technical support
software.
<P>
<B>Time-Saving Solution</B> 
<P>
In keeping with the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model proposed by 
the Gartner Group, a high-tech marketing research firm in Stamford,
Conn., AST has designed AST-LifeLine to address the critical issue
of help desk automation.
<P>
&quot;We know that approximately 30 percent of calls to help desks
are repetitive problems,&quot; Raybin noted.
<P>
AST-LifeLine empowers a user to quickly solve the most common PC 
problems through the use of an automated agent. If a solution is 
not obvious, the user will then be connected to a technical support 
person who has the capability to look at the user's system files.
<P>
&quot;By utilizing a single phone line and our new AST-LifeLine
software, a PC support technician can remotely diagnose and repair a 
user's hardware and software problems -- one call often does it all! 
With AST-LifeLine, there is no waiting for the time-absorbing scenario
of phone calls repeatedly made and returned,&quot; she added.
<P>
<B>Comprehensive Tool Kits</B> 
<P>
AST-LifeLine consists of two option kits designed for the needs of 
users as well as service providers and the IS Help Desk.
<P>
<I>End-User Kit</I> 
<P>
Encompassing a comprehensive package of tools that makes remote
diagnosis and technical support possible, the end-user AST-LifeLine
package allows the user to interact with either the IS Help Desk,
an automated service center or AST Technical Support. Contained
within the AST-LifeLine end-user package is:
<UL>
<LI>Boca Research 14.4kbps Data/Fax/Voice Modem
<LI>VoiceView TALK SHOP
<LI>InsideLine Adapter
</UL>
<P>

<I>Service Provider and IS Help Desk Kit</I> 
<P>
The service provider and IS Help Desk AST-LifeLine kit allows service 
providers and IS Help Desk technicians to diagnose a customer's system 
in the same manner provided by AST Technical Support. Additionally,
information gathered by the service provider or IS Help Desk can be 
transmitted directly to AST Technical Support should additional
assistance be needed in resolving the customer's problem. The kit contains:
<UL>
<LI>Boca Research 14.4kbps Data/Fax/Voice Modem
<LI>VoiceView HelpDesk
<LI>VoiceView TALK SHOP
<LI>InsideLine Adapter
</UL>
<P>

Named &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; and &quot;Product of the Year&quot;
in the September, 1995 issue of <I>Telephony</I> magazine, the Boca 
Research 14.4kbps modem offers business users high quality at a 
salient price.
<P>

<B>VoiceView TALK SHOP</B> 
<P>
With TALK SHOP, a user can electronically send and receive virtually
any file currently loaded on the system via a standard telephone
line. No longer are separate lines for voice and data transmission
necessary. Program files, word processing, graphics and spreadsheets
can all be easily transported.
<P>
Using the VoiceView HelpDesk piece of AST-LifeLine, the technician
can view, launch, forward, save, edit or simply delete a file.
<P>
<B>VoiceView HelpDesk</B> 
<P>
HelpDesk is a Windows operating system-based application with specific 
features for technical support call centers that work with users 
running VoiceView TALK SHOP. Technicians can streamline the support 
process thanks to integrated voice and data transmission. HelpDesk 
allows a service technician to look at the troubled system remotely 
while interacting with the customer over the same phone line.
<P>
<B>InsideLine Adapter</B> 
<P>
Understanding that most business phone lines often go through some 
type of digital, PBX or multi-line telephone system, AST has 
incorporated a method of connecting analog devices such as a standard 
modem, fax/modem, fax machine or audio teleconferencing. With AST's 
InsideLine adapter, analog and digital signals are converted as 
necessary to allow data transmission over a business phone line.
<P>
<B>Designed for the Award-Winning Bravo Family</B> 
<P>
Designed for use with AST Bravo and Premmia business systems, 
AST-LifeLine is available as an option with prices starting at $210 for 
the end-user's kit and $640 for the reseller's package. Most recently 
named to <I>PC World's</I> December list of &quot;Top 20 Power 
Desktops,&quot; the Intel&#174 Pentium&#174-based AST business PC 
family members have garnered praise from the likes of <I>Computer 
Reseller News</I> and <I>Windows Magazine</I> for producing a 
&quot;powerhouse&quot; machine that &quot;packs plenty of punch.&quot;
<P>
<B>Worldwide Service and Support</B> 
<P>
AST backs all of its products with a host of multi-source support
programs including a toll-free &quot;hot&quot; line for users in the 
U.S., AST InfoLine, an interactive voice-response system with 
fax-response diagnostics and instructions, and Info-FAX, a 24-hour local
