</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., June 28, 1996 -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA--NASDAQ)
announced today it will receive $60 million from Samsung Electronics that will
be used to help pay off a $90 million promissory note due to Tandy
Corp. related to the 1993 acquisition of Tandy Corp.'s PC manufacturing
operations.
<P>
In return for the $60 million, Samsung will receive an equal
value of newly-issued shares that could bring Samsung's total
ownership of shares and options up to a maximum of 49.9 percent
of AST's outstanding shares.  Any amount still owed to Samsung
following achievement of the 49.9 percent limit would be paid
in the form of a three-year promissory note.  AST is also in discussions
with Tandy to satisfy the remaining balance of the promissory
note with, at the company's discretion, a combination of cash
or newly-issued shares.
<P>
AST also announced that it has entered into a $15 million intellectual
property assignment agreement with Samsung to transfer three families
of patent applications to Samsung.  The patent applications relate
to a semiconductor chip design project that was ongoing at AST
during 1994 and 1995, but which was not eventually used by AST.
<P>
Samsung also obtained an option to acquire eight additional families
of patent applications which came from that same semiconductor
chip design project.  The option is excercisable at a price to
be determined in the future.  AST also obtains a perpetual license
under the patent applications.
<P>
Samsung has significant business in semiconductor chip design.
AST continues to maintain a large portfolio of patents and patent
applications.
<P>
The shares of AST stock are being sold or transferred in private
transactions, are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
and will be subject to resale restrictions until and unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
