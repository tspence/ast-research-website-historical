<P>IRVINE, Calif., October 15, 1997 – With the redesign of its World Wide Web site, AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer is making another move toward providing unparalleled service to its customers – a primary initiative of the company since it became a part of the Samsung group, forming the "New AST."</P>
<P>&#9;AST’s completely redesigned Web site (www.ast.com ), launched recently, utilizes advanced database functionality and intuitive navigational design to link customers, resellers, and sales personnel on a local level, in real time. Customer inquiries now are automatically distributed to all appropriate AST parties, enabling an unprecedented response time. Customers and resellers now also have convenient access to the company’s technical support department, technical data, and multiple customer service programs.</P>
<P>&#9;"AST has created an extremely efficient system for directly connecting resellers and customers," said Tony Amico, director of PC channels research for International Data Corporation. "Uniquely, customers are channeled to resellers that can best fulfill their buying needs, rather than being faced with a general listing of resellers, which is all too common. Clearly, AST designed its easily navigated site with the customers and resellers in mind."</P>

<P>Virtual Paperwork</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;"We are using the capabilities of the Internet and database technologies to gain a competitive edge," said Jack Lamey, AST’s manager, interactive marketing. "This new, intelligently designed Web site, which receives approximately 1 million page hits a week, will help AST form a tighter relationship with its resellers and end-users."</P>
<P>&#9;Leveraging the simplicity of the Web and the complexity of a relational database enables AST to move more quickly in responding to customers’ needs. Lamey added, "So quickly, that upon customer queries, the information is automatically distributed in real-time to the appropriate reseller and AST sales professional according to the specific customer’s geographical area and system requirements. Few, if any, competitors can provide this level of service."</P>
<B><U><P>A Virtual Hand</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;Further evidence of its responsiveness to customers’ needs, AST’s new Web site hosts a redesigned customer technical support area, which is based on lessons learned from more than 2,500 customer queries received during an average week. </P>
<P>&#9;"Customers’ needs change as technology advances," Lamey added. "We’ve responded with intuitive Web navigational tools, making it easier for end-users to find authorized service centers, manuals, and technical information specific to their machines."</P>
<P>&#9;AST customers looking for technical information on the company’s notebooks, desktops, or servers now can quickly find it via Web-page labels arranged according to the AST product brand. Requiring no more than four clicks, all AST product brands are quickly identified, and information as specific as machine components is accessed. Product service manuals can be downloaded with the click of a mouse.</P>
<P>&#9;Lamey pointed out that the debut of the new Web site symbolizes "The New AST," and highlights the company’s first-ever tri-product introduction, which includes the new line of AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> HS application servers, Ascentia<SUP>&trade;</SUP> M notebook series, and Bravo MS desktops.</P>
<P>&#9;AST-authorized Service Centers worldwide are found just as easily as the products. Users immediately are given the appropriate location by entering either postal zip code, telephone area code, or the city. </P>
<P>&#9;Lamey added that visitors are now presented with a new intuitive frequently-asked-questions (FAQ) area, providing them another opportunity to find the information they need quickly. Additionally, AST customers now can register their products online.</P>
<B><U><P>Resellers’ InterChange</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;AST’s InterChange, the company’s extranet for resellers, provides them private access to special programs designed to meet their needs, and lays the foundation for a more efficient and effective manufacturer-reseller relationship. InterChange offers resellers quick access to recent company and product news, and a simple way of ordering AST collateral materials and registering for AST training courses.</P>
<B><U><P>New Look</P>
</B></U><P>The new AST is symbolized graphically throughout the redesigned site. "We focused on making the site customer-focused, responsive, and simple to maneuver; everything visitors might need is immediately recognizable and at their fingertips," Lamey noted. Frames and labels are intuitively applied, and visitors’ navigation now benefits from a low click ratio.</P>
<B><U><P>International Flavor</P>
</B></U><P>International AST divisions also are participating in the unveiling of the new AST Web identity. "One of our initiatives is to localize site content internationally," Lamey said. Currently, six countries including UK/Ireland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Canada, and France have created versions of the AST Web site that are appropriate to their languages and cultures.</P>
