<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The Pentium II provides the power of the Pentium Pro, it adds MMX technology and doubles the L1 cache to 32KB. All AST Bravo Pentium II systems will ship with 512KB of L2 cache, twice as much as a typical Pentium Pro system.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Based on the iCOMP 2.0 Index the Pentium II 266MHz and Pentium II 233MHz processors outperform the Pentium Pro 200MHz processor by 37.7% and 21.4%, respectively.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Intel<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 440LX AGPset</B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>A new Intel designed core logic that enables the use of advanced technology such as AGP, SDRAM, ACPI, and UltraDMA-33.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Better system integration between components and the core logic which translates into improved system performance.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>In addition to increased performance, the chipset enables new power management features to allow a desktop user to have the same "suspend/resume" mode as they have on their notebook.</FONT></TD>

<TR><TD WIDTH="21%" VALIGN="TOP">
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port)</B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>A new graphics port enabled by the new 440LX core logic. The AGP implementation provides a dedicated point-to-point connection between AGP and the 440LX core logic, enabling a transfer rate of &gt;500MB/s.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>With a dedicated point-to-point AGP connection the PCI bus is no longer burdened by graphics. AGP provides for scaleable graphics and will use main system memory if necessary to store textures.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Your system's "effective bandwidth" is dramatically improved. With AGP the PCI bus is freed for use with non-graphic related peripherals such as HDD, CD-ROM, Ethernet, etc.</FONT></TD>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>UltraDMA33 S.M.A.R.T. HDD</B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>UltraDMA-33 represents the latest evolution of IDE hard drive technology. The burst transfer rate has been increased from 16.7MB/s to 33 MB/s. Cyclical Redundancy Checking (CRC) provides increased data integrity. Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) allows your hard drive to communicate its predicted reliability status.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>An UltraDMA-33 HDD provides about a 10% performance increase in disk-oriented benchmark tests. Increasing the transfer rate brings the effective transfer rate of the system's bus and a drive's internal data rate into balance. Without risking data loss, administrators can proactively manage component replacement.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Your system will boot faster, and applications requiring long sequential transfers (such as multimedia-enhanced presentations) will run smoothly. System downtime, productivity loss, and even loss of valuable data can be prevented through the combined use of S.M.A.R.T. drives and Intel LanDESK software.</FONT></TD>

<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The 3D Rage&trade;II+DVD delivers superior 3D features and performance including perspective correct texturing, video texturing, Gouraud shading and a host of other 3D special effects. Superior 2D acceleration is achieved through an advanced architecture which is optimized for SGRAM. Also featured is the ATI AMC (Multimedia Connector) for expanded graphics capability.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The ATI Rage&trade;II+DVD offers perhaps the best combination of value and performance. As an integrated solution the Rage&trade;II+DVD brings you excellent 2D and 3D performance at a cost lower that a typical 2D add-on card. The AMC connector allows you to add the graphics functions you need (TV, video capture or MPEG II).</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Graphics intensive applications such as Microsoft&reg; PowerPoint, and Excel will run noticeably faster. Web-based Java and VRML programs can take advantage of the 3D features to display stunning images. To allow maximum flexibility, users can expand their memory to 4MB of SGRAM</FONT></TD>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>SGRAM Video Memory</B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>SGRAM refers to synchronous graphics RAM, a type of single-ported, high-performance graphics memory that delivers performance close to the level of expensive dual ported VRAM and WRAM, in a highly cost-effective single ported memory configuration.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>2MBs of SGRAM delivers the performance of 4MB of EDO for much lower cost than EDO or other graphics alternatives.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Up to 25% faster graphics performance can be achieved when running Windows&reg; 95 at 1024 X 768 X 256 colors (compared to EDO-based video memory configurations). Applications such as PowerPoint, Quicktime and ACAD will derive the maximum benefit from this feature. </FONT></TD>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Two USB Ports</B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The Universal Serial Bus is an Intel supported standard which can operate at two speeds, 12Mps for high bandwith devices and 1.5Mps for lower-speed devices. USB can support up to 127 devices on one port as well as supply power to connected devices.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>USB will increase the ease of adding new devices to your PC. The USB port, being "universal", eliminates the need for multiple connectors. USB allows peripherals to act as hubs so that up to 127 devices can be connected to your PC via one cable with one USB port. The added benefit of this is reduced cable clutter.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>USB will lessen the time it takes to connect and set-up devices on your PC. When a device is connected USB automatically senses what driver and bus resources are needed which will save time and frustration. USB is also plug-and-play: devices can be attached and detached while system is running.</FONT></TD>

<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Rather than wait for a component failure or environmental condition to cause the system to fail, administrators can now proactively manage the PC’s under their control.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Users will not suffer from unexpected downtime. Airflow problems created by either inadequate cooling space around the PC, (which cause the system to heat up and accelerate component failure) can now be detected and rectified. Power supply output can be monitored for the correct voltage range.</FONT></TD>

<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>System Noise Reduction </B></FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>System Noise Reduction technology reduces the noise emissions from the system. A room with even a small number of PC's has a high level of background noise to which ordinary PC's contribute. System Noise Reduction technology dampens the noise coming from the most significant 'noise polluter' within the computer (the hard drive).</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>In a small office, particularly open plan, there are many noises to contend with and affect the employee. The contribution to that overall noise level from PC's can be significantly reduced with System Noise Reduction.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="26%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT SIZE=2><P>For the company that wants to improve conditions for employees, the System Noise Reduction technology, present in all Bravos' from AST, makes an important contribution in improving office noise pollution.</FONT></TD>
