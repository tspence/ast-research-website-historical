<B>AST COMPUTER UNVEILS COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO MOVE CORPORATE
CUSTOMERS TO PENTIUM&#174; PRO PROCESSORS AND WINDOWS NT&#174; TECHNOLOGIES
<P>
AST Joins With IDC to Study Corporate Migration Patterns; Employs
Unprecedented Tactics to Enable Smooth Transition to Advanced
Technologies</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

<B>IRVINE, Calif., November 5, 1996</B> - Industry-leading developer
of high-end business desktop systems, AST Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA),
today announced that findings in a new International Data Corporation
(IDC) white paper, entitled <I>The Successful Migration to Next
Generation PCs</I>, clearly support AST's aggressive deployment
strategy for powerful Pentium Pro processor-based commercial desktop
systems.  The white paper, which was sponsored by AST, is phase
one of a comprehensive program AST has designed to help its corporate
customers transition to the 32-bit environment.
<P>
&quot;AST has gone to great lengths to not only validate our
future product direction, but also to help our corporate customers
understand the benefits and challenges they face with the migration
to the latest technologies,&quot; explained Dan Sheppard, vice
president, global corporate marketing at AST.  &quot;In addition
to the study with IDC, AST is conducting worldwide briefings on
the research findings, educating all its employees on the benefits
of Windows NT software and Pentium Pro processors, initiated a
'Test Drive' evaluation program and is also working with Intel&#174;
on their Seed Unit Program.  These types of innovative programs
demonstrate AST's commitment to our customers and reseller partners.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>White Paper Findings</B></U>
<BR>
To confirm the migration pattern of multinational corporations
toward Microsoft&#174; Windows NT&#153; software and Intel&#174; Pentium&#174; Pro technologies,
AST partnered with IDC to conduct a worldwide study and produce
a white paper on the findings.  IDC surveyed 1,500 medium and
large corporations in the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific.
<P>
Since the study addressed advanced Windows NT adoption, IDC focused
on only those corporations who planned to have Windows NT running
on at least ten percent of their total systems within the next
two years.
<P>
IDC research found that there is a planned 150 percent increase
in Windows NT usage from the fall of 1996 to the fall of 1997.
Further, 50 percent of those surveyed stated that at least half
of their PC purchases by the end of 1997 will be Pentium Pro processor-based.
Given these factors, IDC predicts that 1998 will be the pivotal
cross-over year when U.S. Pentium Pro processor-based PC sales
exceed Pentium processor-based PC sales overall, and when Windows
NT installations will surpass Windows&#174; 95 installations on desktops
in large corporations.
<P>
&quot;The results of this survey reinforce our continued belief
that there is a dramatic shift toward Windows NT software and
Pentium Pro processor-based systems in the corporate enterprise,&quot;
stated Chris Yalonis, director of consulting for personal systems,
IDC.  &quot;We have discovered that Corporate America sees Windows
NT as a robust, general-purpose computing operating system which
is very relevant for general business applications, not just high-end
vertical applications.  The data reinforces IDC's outlook that
migration to next-generation desktop systems is happening at a
much faster rate than earlier anticipated.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Declining Advanced PC Costs Add Incentive for Migration</B></U>
<BR>
The study points out that one of the biggest barriers to NT and
Pentium Pro processor adoption is cost of hardware.  However,
IDC also points out that the initial cost of advanced PCs continues
to decline significantly, and cites AST systems as an industry
example.  IDC reports that AST's 1996 Bravo series of advanced
desktop systems are about one-third lower when compared to the
advanced desktop systems AST offered in late 1994.  Furthermore,
IDC reports that true PC cost-to-use factors (which are actually
more than 90 percent related to training and support staffing)
favor the reliability, security and overall performance of the
NT software and Pentium Pro processor combination.
<P>
<U><B>AST Matches IDC Recommendations</B></U>
<BR>
IDC explains that choosing the right vendor is as important as
choosing the right PC.  Supporting AST's aggressive pricing on
its Bravo systems, IDC urges customers to look for the PC vendors
that push the price performance ratios and offer the most complete
value package.  Also cited as very important is the level of technical
support offered by the vendor as well as related costs.
<P>
&quot;AST has taken the lead in service and support as well as
implementing industry-leading pricing on our commercial desktop
computers,&quot; commented Laura Raybin, AST's director of worldwide
product marketing for commercial desktops and advanced systems.
&quot;In fact, AST continues to set new levels of industry
excellence in service and support.  Within the past year, AST
has reduced the average call wait time from six minutes to one
minute.  And our spare parts fill rate has exceeded our goal of
95 percent - reaching a high of 96.5 percent.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>AST Sets New Standard with Education Programs</B></U>
<BR>
To provide customers with the variety of programs they need to
make an educated decision, AST has developed additional programs
to help them move to 32-bit computing applications.  AST's Test
Drive Program allows qualifying prospective customers to evaluate
Bravo MS-T Pro Series systems at their own pace.  The Test Drive
Program works concurrently with Intel's Seed Unit Program, of
which AST is one of six select participants.  Intel's program
is designed to provide large corporations with the opportunity
to evaluate Pentium Pro technology within their own environment.
In addition to systems, AST is providing a warranty upgrade promotion,
enhanced technical support options and easy to read information
sheets.
<P>
<U><B>AST's Windows NT Software and Pentium Pro Processor Solutions</B></U>
<BR>
AST has committed to meet this rapidly increasing demand for Windows
NT software Pentium Pro processor-based systems with its powerful
line of Bravo commercial desktops.  Bravo MS-T 6180 and 6200 desktop
minitowers are bundled with Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and feature
powerful 180- and 200MHz Pentium Pro processors to take full advantage
of 32-bit applications.  
<P>
On its high-powered desktop Bravo systems, AST takes communications
to new heights with its first-of-a kind network browsing, Web
authoring software bundle - AST-IntraAccess.  This type of leading-edge
innovation puts AST ahead of the pack for corporate computing
solutions. AST-IntraAccess provides commercial customers with
a complete network browsing and Web authoring software bundle,
and includes all of the software that is necessary to make sharing
data via a company Intranet a breeze.

<U><B>IDC Survey Background and White Paper Availability</B></U>
<BR>
The white paper entitled, <I>The Successful Migration to Next
Generation PCs</I> is based on research performed by IDC in the
summer of 1996.  IDC surveyed 500 IT and department managers in
medium and large U.S. corporations on their advanced desktop PC
usage and plans.  
<P>
Parallel research programs implemented in Europe and Asia were
also performed to obtain a global market perspective from more
than 1,500 worldwide business enterprises.  Overall, the IDC survey
was conducted in 12 countries and in nine languages worldwide.
International survey results show that by late 1997 there is
expected to be a 500 percent increase in Windows NT usage among
European corporate users, and a 400 percent increase in Windows
NT usage among Asian corporate users.  The white paper can be
obtained by calling (800) 447-0023, ext. 100.
