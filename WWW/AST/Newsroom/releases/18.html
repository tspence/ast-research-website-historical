IRVINE, Calif., March 17, 1997 -- AST&reg; Computer (NASDAQ: ASTA)
and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that AST Bravo PC users will
soon have the power of speech recognition technology on their
desktops.  The first non-IBM manufacturer to equip its systems
with VoiceType 3.0, AST will preload its Bravo commercial desktop
computers with IBM's innovative software.  Continuing its strategy
of being first-to-market with leading-edge technology, AST is
scheduled to begin shipments of the speech-enabled Bravo in the
second quarter.  
<P>
&quot;Our corporate users are hungry for technologies that allow
them to efficiently and effectively multi-task in an ever-changing
demanding environment,&quot; stated Laura Raybin, director, brand
marketing, AST Computer.  &quot;By preloading our Bravo systems
with voice recognition software, we are equipping our customers
with another tool to increase their office productivity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
Without even touching a keyboard or mouse, Bravo PC users will
be able to open applications, dictate memos, surf the Internet
and send e-mail messages, simply by speaking to their computers.
 VoiceType 3.0 for Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 95 allows people
to dictate 70-100 words per minute at an average accuracy rate
of 90 percent to help corporate users become more productive.
 Its advanced features include speaker independence so that people
do not have to train their computers to their individual voice
patterns.  The software's adaptive learning capability means that
the accuracy of word and accent recognition improves with use.
<P>
&quot;We are very happy that AST has chosen VoiceType to provide
their customers with an exciting technology that will transform
the way they work,&quot; said Jan Winston, worldwide speech systems
manager.  &quot;The preload of VoiceType on the AST commercial
computer line-up will allow professionals to readily experience
the benefits of speech technology, such as productivity and ease
of use.&quot;
<P>
The VoiceType software on AST's award-winning Bravo PCs will support
a number of languages, including American and UK English, Spanish,
German, Italian, French and Japanese.
