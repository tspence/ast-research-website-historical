IRVINE, Calif., May 19, 1997 --  Time is critical when it comes
to business and AST Computer is supporting its server customers
by unveiling a new and improved Guardian Care<SUP>&#153;</SUP>
program that features a four-hour response time.  Taking the time
to listen to its customers, AST recognizes that selling a system
is just the beginning of a long relationship where service &amp;
support is a crucial element.
<P>
 Guardian Care, available as an optional upgrade package with
AST's current Manhattan<SUP>&#153;</SUP> family of server products,
arms network administrators with the assurance that their complex
server environments are backed by top-of-the-line technicians
who understand what it takes to keep their systems up and running
-- day or night.
<P>
 &quot;AST server products are designed to become the brainstem
of a business organization,&quot; said David Tordoff, AST's director
of service marketing.  &quot;When a system goes off-line and affects
a users' ability to have uninterrupted access to its information,
a timely response can be critical to the success of a business.
 AST's Guardian Care program is designed to provide a quick and
accurate response for any server problem that may occur.&quot;
<P>
 Guardian Care is a highly responsive service program that ensures
the maximum level of support for AST servers and includes:
<UL>

will be scheduled to be on-site within four hours of being dispatched

needs up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year
