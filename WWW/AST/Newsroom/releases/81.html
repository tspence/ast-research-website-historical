<B>AST COMPUTER LEAPS AHEAD OF THE PACK WITH 
INNOVATIVE OVATION! PROGRAM</B>
<P>
<B>New Marketing Program Gives VARs More Bang For Their Buck</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 4, 1996  -- Giving a whole new meaning to
the word support, AST&#174; Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA) today announced its
innovative and revolutionary AST Ovation!&#153; program for its
reseller partners.  The AST Ovation! program is designed to provide
a comprehensive arsenal of marketing tools and programs to empower
AST VARs to more efficiently and effectively market AST products.
 Kicking off the Ovation! program is a seminar series portfolio,
marketing templates and business development guides now available
to designated resellers.
<P>
&quot;Imagine being able to generate high-quality leads in a
cost-effective and focused manner.  AST has made it possible with
the Ovation! program,&quot; stated Gary Mullinix, vice president
of U.S. sales for AST.  &quot;VARs and resellers can select from
a menu of tools and programs which they feel would be most beneficial
to their marketing efforts.  What this means to the reseller is
an increase in return on investment by leveraging the national
marketing efforts of AST.&quot;
<P>
According to AST, the true beauty of the Ovation! multi-tier
program is its simplicity.  The Ovation! program provides a comprehensive
offering of turnkey programs and templates, which are designed
to include further developments to keep the program fresh and
effective.  The reseller simply chooses the program offerings
that best suits their needs and orders from a provided form. 
For extensive support, special AST Ovation! consultants will guide
the reseller to the most appropriate and cost-effective solution.
<P>
&quot;What we have created with the Ovation! program is a series
of value-added programs which help enable our resellers and VARs
to quickly get their product into the hands of their customers.
The Ovation! program provides a series of building blocks that
maximize AST's first-to-market strategy while helping to provide
improved margins for resellers,&quot; Mullinix added.
<P>
Ovation! was created by AST to support qualifying resellers through
individualized business development assistance.  AST has demonstrated
its dedication to the success of its resellers through helping
to increase reseller productivity and enhance sales efficiency.
<P>
<B>Giving New Meaning To Turnkey Programs</B>
<BR>
AST has truly stepped out of the box with the Ovation! program
-- providing a new level of support to resellers.  In the area
of sales impact, AST leads the way with their Niche Marketing
Series, which helps resellers generate responses from a particular
target market at a very low cost.  Through the Ovation! Trade
Show Loaner Booth program, resellers can also make a strong impact
at industry trade shows.
<P>
To aid resellers in the area of business development, Ovation!
also offers a Better Business Teleconference Series.  These are
convenient, telephone-based seminars lead by industry professionals
that provide practical how-to information on sales, marketing
and business development topics.  Also offered is a Peer Group
Information Exchange.  Sponsored by AST and other industry organizations,
quarterly conference calls and annual in-person meetings give
AST VARs a unique opportunity to gain valuable business insights
and learn about best practices from their peers in a non-competitive
environment.
<P>
<B>More Than Lip Service</B>
<BR>
One of the offerings that truly sets the Ovation! program apart
is the Seminar Series Portfolio, a prepackaged seminar that enables
the reseller to make an informed, illustrated presentation.  For
example, the first seminar package available is &quot;AST Computer:
Unlock the Power,&quot; which is based on recently announced findings
in a new International Data Corporation (IDC) white paper.  The
seminar package is designed to help resellers educate their corporate
customers on the transition to the 32-bit environment and includes
a professionally designed PowerPoint&#174; presentation, an expertly-written
script, data sheets and invitations.
<P>
<B>Getting Out From Under The Shell</B>
<BR>
With limited resources and time, many VARs have difficulty developing
effective, comprehensive programs.  AST provides a solution through
the Ovation! program.  Standardized AST Ovation! shells/templates
enable resellers to greatly reduce the cost of developing customized
marketing materials.  Professionally produced, four-color collateral
pieces are available and come in Invitation, News Flash and Tri-Fold
Mailer shells.  
<P>
Each piece in the Ovation! program leaves plenty of designated
space for the insertion of reseller-specific copy, photography
and artwork.  Currently, Ovation! is offering AST Ascentia&#153; P Model
Update News Flash Mailer and the Manhattan&#153; Presence Pro Tri-Fold
Mailer.
<P>
<B>Reaching For The Gold - Together</B>
<BR>
Kicking off the Ovation! program and available immediately are
the Marketing Shells, News Flash Mailer, Tri-Fold Mailer, Announcement
Mailer and Seminar Series Portfolio featuring &quot;AST Computer:
Unlock the Power.&quot;  Because the Ovation! program is designed
to be updated, new templates, activities and services may be added
to the program on a regular basis.  Resellers interested in participating
can call AST Ovation! program management at (800) 886-7697.
