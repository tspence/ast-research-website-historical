<B>AST AND INTEL TEAM UP TO LET CONSUMERS SEE AND BE SEEN WITH



NEW VIDEO PHONE TECHNOLOGY<P>







Advantage! Multimedia PCs To Incorporate Intel Video Phone



and ProShare&#153; Technology</B></CENTER>



<P>



IRVINE, Calif., June 6, 1996 -- Riding the crest of its first-to-market



success with innovative, leading-edge technology, AST Computer



today announced that it will give new meaning to communications



and the consumer PC by integrating Intel's award-winning ProShare



technology into its Advantage! line of multimedia PCs.



<P>



The Intel Video Phone, which works over normal telephone lines,



is an extension of Intel's ProShare video conferencing technology



that has been in use by the commercial world for the past several



years.  By incorporating this new video conferencing technology



into the Advantage! line of computers, AST is helping to redefine



the home PC as a true hub of communication and networking activity.



<P>



&quot;We applaud AST Computer for being quick to recognize the



importance of integrating video phone technology into the home



computer,&quot; stated Intel's Frank Gill, executive vice president



of the Internet and communications group.  &quot;Together, Intel



and AST are setting new standards of excellence in the explosive



world of telecommunications and the home by offering a cost-effective,



viable solution that will let families stay in touch in a more



personal and realistic manner.&quot;



<P>



The combination of  Intel's Video Phone with ProShare technology



and AST's Pentium&#34; processor-based Advantage! PCs allows consumers



to enhance a standard telephone call by adding video to see who



they are calling. The Intel Video Phone features a &quot;voice



call first&quot; capability that allows the user to initiate or



receive a call via a standard telephone line and then move to



the PC to add video to the same call.



<P>



&quot;Just imagine being able to stay in touch with family members



living in other cities; parents with children in college; grandparents



wanting to see the first photo from their new grandchild -- the



possibilities are endless,&quot; stated Dan Sheppard, vice president



of worldwide product marketing for AST.



<P>



&quot;We believe that there is a vast market for video phone-enabled



PCs, and our Pentium processor-based Advantage! PCs will allow



the Intel Video Phone to take full advantage of the these high-performance



systems,&quot; Sheppard added.



<P>



The Intel Video Phone features the ability to send a high resolution



snapshot during the video call and to store it for future reference.



Compliant with telecommunications standards, the Intel Video



Phone conforms to the H.324 standard for video and audio over



analog phone lines, ensuring that the AST Phone Center will be



able to communicate over analog lines with video phone offerings



from multiple vendors.
