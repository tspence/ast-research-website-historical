<B>AST COMPUTER PARTICIPATES IN NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY
INITIATIVE AT E3 TRADE SHOW</B></CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., May 8, 1996 -- Demonstrating its commitment to
the youth of America, AST Computer today announced its participation
in Net-A-Thon, a National Education Technology (NET) Initiative
program designed to raise funds that will be used to provide computers
and computer software to America's public schools.
<P>
&quot;The youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow,&quot;
said AST's Dan Sheppard, vice president of worldwide product marketing,
and a founding advisory board member of NET Initiative.   &quot;As
a major corporate sponsor of this organization, we recognize the
importance of technology in education and we heartily endorse
and support the efforts of the NET Initiative.&quot;
<P>
NET Initiative, a newly formed nonprofit organization, is raising
money to supply schools across the country with computers through
an on-line Internet-A-Thon, coinciding with this year's Electronic
Entertainment Expo (E3) being held May 16 - 19 at the Los Angeles
Convention Center in Los Angeles.
<P>
A cross between a telethon and charity silent auction, this first-of-a-kind
Net-A-Thon will be held each May and November to coincide with
the $100 billion technology industry's two biggest trade shows,
E3 and Comdex.  These two yearly events alone attract more than
250,000 participants.
<P>
Funded by private and corporate contributions via fundraising
activities, the NET Initiative represents a collaboration of the
largest software and hardware manufacturers including Intel Corp.,
Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and AST Computer, as well
as celebrities, working together for the betterment of America's
youth.
<P>
Items being offered at this premiere Net-A-Thon range from multimedia
CD-ROMs and computer hardware to autographed rock guitars and
works of art.  Anyone visiting the NET Initiative's website at
www.NETI.org can bid on items, make a donation or surf through
the list of donated items including PC systems from AST Computer.

<U><B> White House Support For NET-A-Thon</B></U>
<BR>
Officially kicked off at the Internet World trade show in San
Jose, Calif., the Net-A-Thon will culminate May 16 at E3 with
a White House presentation on the importance of the Net Initiative.
 A free resource guide highlighting hardware and software companies
offering educational discounts to schools is available to all
educators.  The resource guide will be available in print and
electronic form.
<P>
According to President Bill Clinton, &quot;The NET Initiative's
Internet-A-Thon is a great opportunity for those who have benefitted
most from technology to reach out to the next generation of Americans.
 By uniting consumers, retailers, hardware manufacturers and software
publishers on-line, this effort will strengthen education and
help our children succeed.&quot;
