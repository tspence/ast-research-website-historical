IRVINE, Calif., May 7, 1997 - Listening to what users want is
something that AST Computer has learned to do well.  With the
introduction of its latest Bravo commercial desktop, the Bravo
LC 6233, AST has not only listened - but delivered what customers
are demanding: superior computing performance without the initial
overhead cost of a lot of bells and whistles that can easily be
added as a business grows. The Pentium II processor-based Bravo
LC 6233 provides small and medium-sized business users the solutions
they need to run today's demanding applications with the headroom
to easily manage tomorrow's challenges.
<P>
 &quot;Today marks the beginning of a new generation of AST Computer
products,&quot; stated Laura Raybin, AST's director of Brand Marketing.
 &quot;We are responding to what our small and medium-sized business
users want -- a robust, innovative, solid solution with superior
service and support at an extraordinary value -- and that's just
what the Bravo LC 6233 delivers.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>The Pentium Pro Processor Meets MMX Technology</B></U>
<P>
 With the new Bravo LC 6233, AST continues its tradition of being
first-to-market with leading-edge technology.  The Intel Pentium
II processor is Intel's fastest processor to date, combining the
power of the Pentium Pro processor, with the capabilities of Intel's
MMX media enhancement technology, giving business users the power
to handle the most compute-intensive business applications.
<P>
 The Pentium II processor also utilizes an innovative packaging
technology called Single Edge Contact (S.E.C.) Cartridge which
replaces Pin Grid Array (PGA) technology used on previous Intel
processors.  The most notable change to the Pentium II chip is
that the level two cache and processors are integrated on a card,
not a chip as in the Pentium Pro.  With S.E.C., the Bravo LC 6233
is able to take advantage of future planned upgrades to Intel
Pentium II processors, while remaining compatible with applications
running on previous members of the Intel microprocessor family.
<P>
 &quot;AST is helping users in small and medium-size business
to more efficiently and effectively drive business computing by
combining their legacy of superior computing solutions with the
latest Intel Pentium II processor,&quot; stated Paul S. Otellini,
executive vice president, Sales and Marketing Group at Intel.
 &quot;This combination will provide these users with the performance
and flexibility to meet their computing needs.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Ideal For Resellers</B></U>
<P>
 Small and medium-size business users are not the only ones who
benefit from the latest Bravo offering. The new Bravo LC is also
an ideal solution for the reseller, offering the flexibility to
customize the PC to meet the end-users' requirements today and
tomorrow.
<P>
For those users looking to add-on popular features today, AST
offers the following qualified system add-on options:
<UL>
<LI>Matrox<SUP>&#153;</SUP> Millenium Professional 64-bit PCI

<LI>SoundBlaster<SUP>&#153;</SUP>-compatible 16-bit stereo sound

</UL>
<P>
 &quot;VARs targeting users in small and medium-sized companies
realize that their customers are faced with a myriad of computing
challenges: creating an intranet presence, Web-based activities,
demanding business applications among others,&quot; explained
Raybin.  &quot;This is why the flexibility of the bravo LC system
makes it an ideal solution for our VAR partners.  We believe customers
get the best of all worlds - excellent performance with flexibility
for the future, all in a cost-effective package.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Small Business Means Big Business</B></U>
<P>
 AST understands that technology is changing the way business
users work.  For the small business user especially, productivity
and return on investment are major concerns.  The new Bravo LC
6233 helps users to maximize not only their productivity, but
their business creativity and workflow efficiency through a host
of software and hardware features.
<P>
 Research by AST has shown that more than 68 percent of new job
growth stems from small businesses.  According to the Small Business
Administration, small businesses employ 53 percent of the private
work force in the United States and contribute 47 percent of all
sales in the country.  Recent surveys indicate that almost three-quarters
of new job growth in 1996 stemmed from growth in the small business
segment.  Today, small and medium-sized businesses are clearly
the backbone of the country and represent a growing force of entrepreneurs
that require custom programs and products that will assist them
as they increase internal efficiencies and expand their businesses.
<P>
<U><B>Meeting Today's Needs and Tomorrow's Challenges</B></U>
<P>

hardware technology and Intel's processor brawn.
<P>
 Delivering a good value doesn't mean cutting corners.  The new
Bravo LC 6233 combines the 233MHz Pentium II processor with 512KB
level two pipeline burst cache and up to 128MB memory for fast
system performance and quick number crunching.  Its 2GB EIDE hard

(MAX) CD-ROM drive and S3<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Virge DX graphics accelerator
with 2MB of graphics memory delivers stellar 3D graphics and full
motion video.
