<B>AST REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B>
<P>
Also Announces Reorganization Plans, New CFO, and Global Workforce
Reduction
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., May 2, 1996 -- AST Research, Inc. (ASTA-NASDAQ)
today announced revenues of $530.0 million for the first quarter
of fiscal year 1996, ended Mar. 30.  This compares with revenues
of $670.2 million reported during the comparable prior year period.
<P>
The company reported a net loss of $115.8 million, or net loss
per share of $2.59, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million and
net loss per share of 20 cents reported during the prior year
period.
<P>
AST also announced plans to restructure its worldwide operations,
which will involve organizing the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific
regional operating groups into separate entities, each with distinct
goals and objectives.  The company is also consolidating some
operations, including the closing of certain regional offices.
In addition, the plan will ultimately result in a smaller, centralized
corporate operation at the company's Irvine headquarters.  This
is expected to result in a restructuring charge during the second
quarter of approximately $10 - 15 million, the amount of which
will be determined within the current fiscal period.
<P>
This restructuring activity will result in a layoff of approximately
300 full-time, temporary and contract workers worldwide over the
next few months.  The current plan provides that most sales, service
and product development resources will not be impacted.  The planned
work force reductions will occur throughout other areas of the
company's global organization, including corporate, manufacturing
and the operating  regions.  These actions, when combined with
previously announced layoffs related primarily to manufacturing
realignments in the Far East, will reduce the current worldwide
work force by approximately 1,000 employees.
<P>
In a separate release, AST announced that Joseph E. Norberg will
join the company as senior vice president and chief financial
officer beginning May 6.  He joins AST following tenures with
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Inc., a Boston-based advertising
agency, and Wang Laboratories.
<P>
&quot;While the first quarter revenues and losses were worse
than expected, the company's focus on asset management has continued,
resulting in the highest inventory turn levels in AST's history,&quot;
said Ian Diery, AST president and chief executive officer.  &quot;Lower
sales were caused by excess competitor inventory in the channel,
reduced industry demand for PCs during the first two months of
the quarter and greater pricing pressures than initially anticipated.
Although the company's product development cycle has improved,
product development issues also contributed to the lower-than-expected
results.
<P>
&quot;AST's restructuring activities are designed to provide
greater focus and accountability within the Americas, Europe and
the Asia Pacific regions; further reduce costs; and enhance our
progress in returning to a market share growth position. As the
PC industry becomes more competitive, AST has been forced to adjust
the size of its worldwide staff in order to hasten our return
to profitability.  While we regret the need to take these actions,
I believe they are both necessary and important in improving the
company's long-term outlook.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We strongly support the intense efforts AST is making towards
its turnaround plan and maintain our full confidence in the abilities
of the company's worldwide management team,&quot; said Won S.
Yang, Samsung Electronics senior executive managing director and
an AST board member.  &quot;We believe these actions, together
with the company's new product development capabilities, aggressive
pricing strategy and strengthened service and support operations
will quickly distinguish AST from its competitors.  Samsung will
continue to work closely with AST's management to achieve the
turnaround.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Prior to implementing the product transitions which are
now occurring within the Bravo business desktop and Ascentia mobile
system families, aggressive pricing actions were required during
the first quarter to reduce channel inventories of older products,&quot;
said Diery.  &quot;Moving forward with the support and assistance
of Samsung Electronics, we will continue our highly-proactive
efforts to gain market share and return to profitability.&quot;
<P>
Worldwide revenues for the first quarter included sales of $520.0
million, in addition to $10 million received from Samsung related
to Strategic Consulting and Server Technology Transfer agreements.
Worldwide sales represented a 22 percent decrease from the prior
year period.  Sales of $260.5 million in the Americas and $259.5
in international regions declined 25 and 20 percent, respectively,
compared to the prior year's quarter.  During the quarter, the
company shipped approximately 300,000 units, comprised of 270,000
desktops and 30,000 notebooks.  Shipments of Pentium&#174; and
Pentium&#174; Pro systems, including desktops and notebooks, represented
93 percent of all units shipped.
<P>
<B>Balance Sheet Summary</B>
<P>
During the first quarter, AST continued to focus on improving
its balance sheet and maintaining prudent inventory management.
<P>
At Mar. 30, 1996, total cash and cash equivalents were $126.9
million, with $85.0 million in short-term borrowings.  Total net
inventory was $190.4 million, down from $252.3 million at Dec.
30, 1995 and represented inventory turns of 11.5.  Accounts receivable
totaled $398.3 million, which represented 68 days sales outstanding.
<P>
During the quarter, AST increased its one-year revolving credit
facility from $100 million to $200 million, which is fully available
to the company for its working capital needs and is guaranteed
by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
<P>
<B>First Quarter Summary</B>
<P>
During the quarter, AST revised its business strategy to focus
on being first to bring aggressively-priced, leading-edge PC technologies
to market within the indirect sales channel in order to gain a
competitive advantage over direct manufacturers like Dell and
Gateway 2000, as well as traditional channel suppliers including
Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.  To support this goal and to
become the most reliable supplier to computer resellers, AST is
focused on maintaining short and flexible supply lines.  The company
also made significant improvements to its domestic service and
support operations, which resulted in faster deliveries of spare
parts and reduced wait times on its toll-free telephone support
lines.
<P>
To manifest its first to market strategy and commitment to short
and flexible supply lines, AST has leveraged the strengths of
its strategic relationships with Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics
and other manufacturers.  The company has significantly increased
its use of PC system motherboards from Intel enabling AST to quickly
deliver systems to customers featuring the latest Pentium&#174;
processors and Pentium&#174; Pro processors.
<P>
AST demonstrated progress with its revised business strategy
during the quarter by being first to begin deliveries of several
PC technologies to computer resellers, including: 
<UL>
<LI>Bravo minitower systems based on Intel's Pentium Pro microprocessor
and Microsoft's Windows NT&#153; operating system.
<LI>Ascentia J and P notebook systems featuring Intel's 100- and
133-MHz Pentium microprocessors and advanced features such as
CD-ROM drives, integrated audio and more.
<LI>Bravo systems featuring the Intel 430HX PCIset providing improved
performance in multimedia and other memory-intensive applications.
<LI>Advantage! PCs featuring Intel 166-MHz microprocessors and
6X CD-ROM drives with three-CD minichangers for home and home
office users.
</UL>
<P>
 &quot;Resellers worldwide have expressed strong support and extraordinary
enthusiasm for our new business strategy,&quot; stated Diery.
&quot;During the quarter, many of our indirect channel partners
have begun to lay plans and implement activities to proactively
promote our notebook and desktop products using their own marketing
resources.  These efforts, along with our own aggressive marketing
activities, should help provide additional impetus for achieving
positive momentum.&quot;
<P>
To create excitement and enhance awareness for the company's
new products above and beyond reseller's efforts, AST launched
a comprehensive marketing campaign during the quarter that combines
advertising, public relations and direct mail components, as well
as new enhancements for its Internet Worldwide Web site, now on-line.
The multi-million dollar campaign represents the most aggressive
efforts in the company's history and is expected to play a key
role in AST's efforts to return to profitability and a market
share growth position.
