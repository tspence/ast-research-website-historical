&quot;AST was one of the first PC manufacturers to bring the
Pentium 133MHz processor-based notebook to the market,&quot; explained
Mark Marlow, director, mobile product marketing for AST Computer.
&quot;Now, in its second phase, the high-performance Ascentia
P50 still provides outstanding power, but packs in cutting-edge
features at a price point that is unbeatable.  Customers no longer
have to choose between price or performance - they get the best
of both worlds with the Ascentia P50.&quot;
<P>
AST designed the Ascentia P50 for professionals that require
power, flexibility and  multimedia capabilities for a variety
of on-the-job tasks, but also need to stay within their company's
budget.  And, knowing that today's mobile professional can often
work beyond the normal &quot;9 to 5,&quot; the Ascentia P50 is
the ultimate day-extender, easily taking you from the boardroom
to the home office.  This new notebook is a powerful tool for
those with multiple work sites, such as customer locations, the

<BR>

The Ascentia P50 enables users to have the same ease-of-use as
