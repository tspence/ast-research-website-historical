<UL>
</B><LI>The FlexChassis&trade; design of the AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> HS Server, the first of its new line of high-performance servers, extends the products lifecycle well beyond that of traditional servers by making it incredibly easy to access system components for fast upgrades and easy maintenance. This modular chassis packs 12 front-accessible hot-pluggable drive bays into a 19-inch rack-mountable form factor for a server solution that will grow with today’s fast-paced business needs. </LI>
<LI>The Premium HS Server features dual 300MHz Intel Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> II ECC processors and 440LX core chipset for improved overall system performance. It is also among the first available to incorporate intelligent I<SUB>2</SUB>O-ready Ethernet and RAID controllers. Each controller utilizes a dedicated Intel i960<SUP>&reg;</SUP> RD I/O processor, reducing I/O overhead and increasing overall bandwidth. </LI>
<LI>The Premium HS Server includes fault-tolerant features – traditionally found on higher-end servers costing substantially more – to ensure users get maximum reliability. </LI>
<LI>To better manage mission-critical data, the Premium HS Server is fully instrumented for Intel’s LANDesk&trade; Server Manager software and AST’s Percepta&trade; Pro server monitor agents with SNMP-compliant capability for early detection and fault tolerance. </LI>
<LI>To store large amounts of data, the Premium HS Server has a 12-drive capacity of 108GB – almost twice that of other servers in its class. In addition, the 10,000 RPM Ultra-Wide SCSI drives – standard with the Premium HS Server – reduce data access time by as much as 30 percent less than most drives spinning at 5400-7400 RPM’s. </LI>
<LI>Scheduled to be available in late October through AST-authorized resellers worldwide, estimated street prices for the Premium HS Server are expected to start at $7,349.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 16, 1997 – AST<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Computer, a recognized worldwide supplier of server, desktop, and mobile computers, today announced the development of a new line of high-performance servers called the AST Premium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Server series. The new Premium Server line, following in the footsteps of AST’s original line of highly successful servers from the late 1980’s, debuts with the introduction of the Premium HS Server – a mid-range server targeting medium and large businesses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;The Premium server family will address a broad spectrum of customer demands from entry level to high end. In addition to the new Premium HS Server, which will be available in late October, AST is developing an entry-level Premium GS Server and a high-end Premium KS Server, both of which will be available later this year.</P>
<P>&#9;Modular, affordable, and easy-to-use, AST’s Premium HS Server provides a reliable platform resulting in lower operational risks, lower cost of ownership and extended product life by adapting to the needs of today’s growing businesses. This is accomplished through a combination of hot-pluggable subsystem redundancy, core-component accessibility that makes it easy to service and upgrade, and management software to monitor and control the system down to the component level.</P>
<P>&#9;"High-availability servers must have a sophisticated combination of redundant components, easily replaceable modular systems and comprehensive systems monitoring and control software," said Laura Raybin, director, Brand Marketing, for AST. "AST’s Premium HS Server combines all of these and more with an unwavering commitment to customer service and support."</P>
<B><U><P>Simplistic Serviceability</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;A distinguishing feature of the Premium HS Server is AST’s FlexChassis&trade;, a revolutionary development in server design, simplifying maintenance and overall serviceability. The Premium HS Server’s modular architecture ensures each board and subsystem is easily removable and replaceable. From the advanced NLX-based motherboard, to the hard drives, memory and power supplies, each component is built for easy access and scalability, reducing downtime due to service or maintenance. In addition, enhancements and upgrades can be made in minutes – for a fraction of the cost of a new server.</P>
<P>The Premium HS Server can be used as a stand-alone server or in a standard 19-inch rack cabinet. When placed in a rack, this modular architecture remains easy to service because of its top-entry layout and front-accessible drive bays.</P>
<B><U><P>High-Performance Features Set the Standard for Servers</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;The Premium HS Server offers advanced features that maximize overall server speed and performance for a secure server investment – now and in the future. Incorporated dual 300MHz Intel Pentium<SUP>&reg;</SUP> II ECC processors are combined with Intel’s 440LX core logic chipset for improved overall system performance. To reduce CPU utilization, the Premium HS Server uses the latest I<SUB>2</SUB>0 technology. This allows users to take advantage of performance enhancing software and new peer services layer applications when they become available.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Leading the way in server performance, the Premium HS Sever includes a combination I<SUB>2</SUB>O-ready high-speed SCSI RAID controller – with an Intel i960<SUP>&reg;</SUP> RD I/O CPU – and 10/100 Ethernet server adapter. This specialized interface card, designed by AST, plugs into a dedicated I/O slot and increases the server’s performance over comparable servers using standard interface cards. In addition to increased performance, this combination offers the user the flexibility to build a RAID subsystem in any configuration desired.</P>
<B><U><P>Fault Tolerance Keeps It Up and Running</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;The Premium HS Server minimizes system downtime with a number of high-end fault tolerance standard features. For example, its three rear-extracting, hot-pluggable redundant 330 Watt power supply modules provide ample current to the entire system even in fully loaded configurations. If any one of the modules fail, the system is designed to remain running on the power of the remaining two modules. Each power supply can send a SNMP alert via the server management software in the event of a failure. The failed module can then be replaced without bringing the system off-line, preventing a need for downtime.</P>
<P>&#9;In addition, the server’s cooling fans – one in each of the three power supplies and five others located in removable housings that are easily accessible – provide more than adequate cooling across the cards, power supplies, and drives.</P>
<P>&#9;The Premium HS Server also includes a 12-drive RAID 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, or 50-compliant system with a capacity of 108GB – almost twice the capacity of other servers in its class. To ensure data integrity, each drive within the integrated RAID system is front-loading and hot-pluggable. If a drive should fail, it can be replaced while the system is still functioning. The drives are located behind a locking front bezel to allow secure yet easy access.</P>
<B><U><P>Serious Server Management</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;Each Premium HS Server comes fully instrumented to notify system administrators of anomalies that might lead to expensive downtime. Whether it is as simple as a disk becoming full or a power supply failure, the server management software can take steps to help maintain trouble-free operation.</P>
<P>The Premium line comes complete with Intel’s LANDesk<FONT FACE="Symbol">&Ocirc;</FONT> Server Manager software and AST’s SNMP-compliant Percepta&trade; Pro Server monitor agents. High-level management features include monitoring processor health and voltages, system temperatures at various locations, and fan speeds; while embedded low-level diagnostics can test and report component-level functionality. These fault-isolation features help ensure that the Premium HS Server is always running in optimal condition.</P>
<B><U><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inspiring Customer Support</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;AST stands behind its products with a standard three-year limited warranty that includes next-business-day on-site response and a dedicated, toll-free "hot-line" available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, AST offers Guardian Care<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>SM</SUP></FONT>, an optional, highly responsive support service that includes a four-hour on-site response from engineers specially trained by AST. Finally, to convey a complete commitment to customers’ needs, AST’s entire service-oriented sales, marketing and technical staff is available for customer comments and questions – a true advantage over the competition.</P>
<P>&#9;Several other support options are available to companies who turn to AST for computing solutions. This includes AST’s web site, which offers Web Support via email as well as answers to common technical questions, software and technical bulletins and an index of files and drivers that can be easily downloaded. The company also offers support through AST Online!, its online bulletin board, which is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and its telephone bulletin board at (817) 230-6850.</P>
<B><U><P>Pricing and Availability</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;With estimated street prices starting at $7,349, the Premium HS Server offers one of the best combinations of price and performance available. It is scheduled to be available worldwide starting in late October through AST-authorized resellers.</P>
