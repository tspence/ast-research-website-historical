</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 18, 1996 -- AST Research Inc. (ASTA--NASDAQ)
today announced Noh Byung Park has been named senior vice president,
worldwide product development and manufacturing, and an officer
of the company.
<P>
Dr. Park, a 20-year industry veteran who holds a Ph.D. in computer
engineering from the University of Southern California and also
was a tenured professor of electrical and computer engineering
at the University of California, Irvine, will be responsible for
global product development for the company's Advantage! and Bravo
desktop, Ascentia mobile and Manhattan server brand families.
He will lead teams devoted to product design, engineering, testing,
manufacturing and marketing.
<P>
Prior to his position at AST, Dr. Park was vice president and
general manager of the Computer Division at Samsung Electronics.
He also has held other executive-level engineering positions
at Samsung following his tenure at UC Irvine.
<P>
&quot;As one of the world's foremost experts in computer product
design, development and production, we are expecting Dr. Park
to leverage his knowledge and enthusiasm to increase our top 10
PC industry ranking through the continued availabilty of high-quality,
technically advanced products,&quot; said Y.S. Kim, AST president
and chief executive officer.  &quot;His efforts in these areas
were major factors behind Samsung's achievment of an industry-leading
share of the Korean market in desktop, portable and multimedia
products -- both of which are currently in excess of 30 percent
and well beyond second place competitors.&quot;
<P>
Appointing Dr. Park to lead AST's product development and production
efforts is a key component of the company's enhanced research
and development efforts which are designed to allow the company
to more quickly adapt to changing market requirements.  AST is
in the process of hiring more than 80 engineers and product development
staff in order to expand into new areas, better implement concurrent
product designs and enhance other systems-related activities.
<P>
AST is also receiving assistance on a temporary basis from more
than 30 engineers from Samsung, who will help further the company's
development and design efforts until new AST employees are on
board.
<P>
&quot;Through these efforts, we will bolster AST's reputation
for delivering advanced technologies ahead of competitors,&quot;
said Dr. Park.  &quot;In addition to continuing our strategy of
using third-party motherboard suppliers to be first to market,
we also will work on developing our own designs.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Park will also direct vendor efforts aimed at shortening
and adding flexibility to the AST supply chain, in order to further
enhance the company's ability to quickly adapt to changes in customer
demand.  Just-in-time (JIT) delivery and closely-coupled vendor
ordering and forecasting programs are two primary examples of
the worldwide activities that AST is utilizing to enhance flexibility.
<P>
Dr. Park earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
from Seoul National University, a master's degree in electrical
engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,
and a doctorate in computer engineering from USC.
