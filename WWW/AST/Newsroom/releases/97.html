Stepping up to the challenge of meeting increased throughput and
greater system performance needs in growing network environments,
AST has certified Novell NetWare&reg; 4.1 SMP on the Manhattan P5100
and P5133.
<P>
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is the latest addition
to the NetWare 4 network operating system that provides scalability
for application services.  The scalability of AST Manhattan servers
works in sync with NetWare SMP to accommodate increased users
on the network and more resource-intensive applications.
