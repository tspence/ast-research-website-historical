<B>DALLAS, April 2, 1997</B> --  PC ServiceSource today announced

 Through <B>pc service net</B>, AST service providers will be
able to file paperless warranty claims and do real-time parts
ordering directly from their desktop via the Internet.  AST service

the benefit of real-time parts ordering by streamlining the time

president of service.  &quot;Additionally, being able to track
the warranty claim directly from a desktop gives service providers
new levels of control.  By working with PC ServiceSource, AST
is empowering its service providers and resellers to be best-in-class
and highly responsive.&quot;
