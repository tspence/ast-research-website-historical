<B>HOME OFFICE ENTREPRENEURS GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK WITH LATEST
AST ADVANTAGE! PC SYSTEM</B>
<P>
<B>AST Offers Technology-Packed Home Office PC to Value-Conscious
Consumer</B>

IRVINE, Calif., August 26, 1996 -- Imagine increasing your productivity
and decreasing the time required to complete important tasks while
working from home.  Today that is possible with the AST Computer
(NASDAQ:ASTA) Advantage! Home Office PC, now shipping.
<P>
Recognizing the time constraints on homeworkers and the highly
desired goal of efficiency, the Advantage! 9310 Home Office PC
tackles these needs with specialized features for home office
applications.   By bundling an easy-to-use full-page personal
document scanner, a 33.6 Kbps Data/Fax/Voice modem and an infrared
data communications port with a powerful AST consumer PC, working
from home has never been easier.  
<P>
While offering a bevy of hardware and software features, the
new Advantage! 9310 also meets the needs of the entire family,
from balancing the checkbook and providing family entertainment
to surfing the Internet for timely reference information.

<U><B>Responding to Consumer's Needs</B></U>
<BR>
&quot;The home market has changed dramatically from five years
ago.  AST realizes that this fast-growing segment has evolved
to include multi-users within the family as well as home businesses,&quot;
said Terry Baker, director of marketing, worldwide consumer products.
&quot;Research projections indicate that by the end of the decade,
there will be roughly 120 million PCs in homes in the U.S.  We
know that homeworker households account for 68 percent of the
total consumer PC installed base and view this as an incredible
opportunity for specialized systems.&quot;
<P>
Research from IDC/Link shows that work at home is increasing
across the board for all types of home workers.  Corporate downsizing
has left a lot of highly skilled and qualified workers out of
the traditional corporate work force.  Many of these workers are
making use of their skills by  becoming independent contractors
and freelancers, giving rise to small home-based businesses. IDC/Link's
research has shown that 73 percent of home office households planning
to purchase a PC within a year will buy a multimedia computer.
The lower cost of acquisition of key platforms and services is
further fueling the adoption of information and communications
technologies by &quot;technopreneurs.&quot;  Since home office
&quot;technopreneurs&quot; are the first to migrate to new technology,
this opens up the window of opportunity for more PCs that are
aimed at diverging and segmenting consumers.
<P>
<U><B>Leading the Pack with Hot New Technologies</B></U>
<BR>
The new Advantage! Home Office PC features innovative and advanced
hardware and software tailored to meet the varying needs of consumers.
These consumer PC technological advances make AST's Home Office
PC one of the most complete lifestyle solutions available today
on a consumer system.
<P>
<I><B>Full-Page Personal Document Scanner</B>: </I>Adding to the
ideal home-office productivity solution, the Advantage! 9310 home
office PC features a full-page personal document scanner that
reads documents into the computer for editing, faxing and filing.
Now instead of typing in information from a document, a user
can simply feed the page through the scanner, have it appear on
the screen, edit the content and save it in the appropriate software
application.  A complete scanning software package is also included.
<P>
<I><B>Infrared Data Communications Port:</B>  </I>Recognizing
the increasingly mobile society in which we now<I> </I>live, an
Infrared Data Communications Port has been included in AST's Home
Office PC.  An infrared data communications port allows for the
wireless infrared data transfer of files between a desktop PC
and a mobile computer, thereby dramatically decreasing the amount
of time needed to complete this task.  So a user getting ready
to jump on a plane can quickly copy documents from a desktop PC
to a notebook computer by simply placing the corresponding infrared
ports next to each other and pushing a button.
<P>
<I><B>33.6 Kbps Data/Fax/Voice Modem:</B></I>  Searching the Internet
for up-to-the-minute financial and business information is a breeze
with a 33.6 Kbps Data/Fax/Voice modem on the Advantage! 9310.
Recognizing the importance of being able to access and communicate
data quickly to clients across town, AST has designed its Home
Office system to make operating a business from home easier than
ever before.
<P>
Competitively priced at $2,499 and powered by an Intel Pentium
166MHz processor, the Advantage! Home Office system features a
2.5GB hard drive, 24MB RAM, 256KB pipeline-burst cache, 33.6 Kbps
modem, 8-speed CD-ROM drive and hardware wavetable.  Complimented
