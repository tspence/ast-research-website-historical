LAS VEGAS, Nov. 14, 1996 - AST Computer (NASDAQ: ASTA), a leader
in new technology implementation, innovatively brings the sights
and sounds of COMDEX '96 right to your PC.  Using the new Manhattan&#153;
Presence Pro Internet server, AST is transmitting a live broadcast
feed from AST's booth directly to the company's ASTVnet web site.
AST has commissioned InterNT to deliver a &quot;live Webcast&quot;
of COMDEX, allowing those with Internet access the ability to
experience COMDEX from anywhere in the world.  Providing minute-by-minute
action, AST's Website is easily accessed at http://www.ast.com
continuously throughout the show, Nov. 18 - 22.
<P>
&quot;By combining AST's state-of-the-art hardware with today's
advanced technologies, AST is able to provide the powerful solutions
to make this unique interactive experience possible,&quot; said
Dan Sheppard, vice president of global corporate marketing at
AST. &quot;AST took the lead by introducing this technology application
at COMDEX/Canada last July.  Again, we're expecting thousands
to log on, and for many, experience live audio and video for the
first time.&quot;
