IRVINE, Calif., July 21, 1997 &#150; At AST, being responsive to customer needs begins at the design table.  With its latest Bravo LC commercial desktop systems, AST&#174; Computer delivers the right combination of value, performance and ease of use for the needs of PC users at small to medium-sized businesses.  Designed specifically for the demands of this market, AST's Bravo LC line provides users with the dependable and upgradeable systems they are looking for at a price they can afford.<BR>
<P>
&#34;When purchasing computers, all companies are really looking for peace of mind &#150; confidence that their purchase was the right decision.  For small to medium-sized businesses, they tend to be looking for systems that are dependable, upgradeable and valuable,&#34; explained Laura Raybin, director, brand marketing.<BR>
<P>
Incorporating a user-friendly design and backed by significant service and support programs, the Bravo LC line enables users to concentrate on running their businesses instead of their computers.  From their inception, these systems were designed to provide businesses with a total computing solution through ease of use, service, support and desktop manageability.<BR>
<P>
<B>Ease of Use</B><BR>
AST's FlexChassis makes serviceability a snap with the world's first flexible chassis based on Intel's new NLX standard.  With the simple push of a button, components such as memory and the CPU can be easily accessed and removed for service, dramatically reducing the time it takes to upgrade systems.  Also, with the flip of a lever, the motherboard slides out as well.  This revolutionary new, screwless design also facilitates quick and easy access to the major system components &#150; RAM, CPU, CD-ROM, floppy drive, hard drive and video RAM &#150; within seconds.<BR>
<P>
&#34;This ease-of-access makes Bravo LC systems arguably the easiest to maintain and upgrade, benefiting both resellers and business users,&#34; added Raybin.<BR>
<P>
The Bravo LC line is equipped with AST's ground-breaking System Noise Reduction &#40;SNR&#41; technology, making it virtually a &#34;Silent PC.&#34;  Building upon its roots as a pioneer in &#34;Green PC&#34; technology, AST is the first computer manufacturer in the world to equip its desktop computers with SNR technology, dramatically reducing their noise profile.<BR>
<P>
SNR technology makes Bravo LC as much as 70-percent quieter than standard PCs.  By incorporating a sound-dampening enclosure, the mechanical noise from the hard drive is greatly reduced.  A variable-speed fan inside the power supply keeps the system cool while generating minimal noise.<BR>
<P>
A 1996 report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended a maximum noise exposure limit of 85 decibels for all combined office equipment.  AST's Bravo LC systems operate at about 28 decibels, well below the NIOSH standard, improving the overall office environment and creating an insurance policy against &#34;white noise pollution&#34; in the workplace.<BR>
<P>
To improve reliability and productivity, the Bravo LC line incorporates the latest revolution in IDE hard drive technology: UltraDMA-33.  This technology enables the system to boot faster and run demanding applications more smoothly &#150; a tremendous benefit to users.  It also doubles transfer rates over standard Programmed Input&#47;Output Mode 4, and its Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology &#40;S.M.A.R.T.&#41; ensures reliable communication with the hard drive, helping solve problems before they actually occur.<BR>
<P>
<B>Improved Performance</B><BR>
The Bravo LC family also features the latest in core logic technology &#150; the Intel&#174; 430TX PCIset &#150;improving system performance as much as 15 percent from previous core logic chipsets.  SDRAM provides the Bravo LC line with the highest memory bandwidth currently available to support enhanced, media-rich performance and reduced memory access time.<BR>
<P>
Available with both Intel's Classic Pentium&#174; processor and Pentium processor with MMX&#153; technology, AST's Bravo LC systems have the power and performance to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses.<BR>
<P>
In addition, AST is helping companies minimize downtime and the cost of IS support.  Bravo LC systems are equipped with AST CommandCenter&#153; software that is designed to help companies better manage their PCs.  One of the most comprehensive desktop management software utility packages available, AST CommandCenter makes management of data and systems faster, more logical and more cost-effective.  Using the latest brand name software solutions from industry leaders, such as Intel's LANDesk&#153; Client Manager 3.0 and McAfee&#174; VirusScan&#153;, this software package optimizes productivity and minimizes application waste.<BR>
<P>
<B>Service and Support</B><BR>
To ensure its users' peace-of-mind, AST provides an arsenal of service and support programs designed to meet their needs, particularly those of small to medium-sized businesses.  AST has developed its Entrepreneurial Edge program specifically for this market.  Committed to being the industry's most responsive PC supplier, AST offers the following value-added benefits as part of this program:<BR>
<ul>
<LI><U>PC Solutions Phone Line</U> &#150; Companies can receive complimentary technology planning assistance through a toll-free number, which is a tremendous value for smaller companies that may not have internal IS resources.  Queries are answered, via fax, within 72 hours.
<LI><U>Custom Web Tools</U> &#150; Companies can visit AST's web site (www.ast.com) for technology overviews that are easy to understand, small business case studies and answers to frequently asked questions.

<LI><U>Product Trade-in &#38; Asset Recovery Program</U> &#150; AST is working with businesses that purchase 25 or more PCs to retrieve and dispose of their existing computer systems.  This is designed to prevent potential penalties which may result from improper disposal of PCs that contain materials such as mercury or lead, which require special disposal procedures.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Several other support options are available to companies who turn to AST for computing solutions.  This includes AST's web site, which offers Web Support via email as well as answers to common technical questions, software and technical bulletins and an index of files and drivers that can be easily downloaded.

<P>
