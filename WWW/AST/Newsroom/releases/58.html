<B>AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGY LEAVES AST COMPETITORS BREATHLESS</B>
<P>
<B>Recent Price Slashings No Match For AST's Already-There Pricing
Strategy</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., May 6, 1996 -- Armed to the teeth with strategic
and well-thought out pricing plans, AST Computer today announced
that despite recent price slashing activities by several major
PC vendors, the company's commercial desktops are still as much
as 35 percent below similarly-equipped models from other PC players.
<P>
&quot;Since we were aggressive last month, we don't have to react
to recent pricing activities now happening because we are already
there,&quot; stated AST's president and chief executive officer,
Ian Diery.  &quot;We are priced well below our major competitors
with comparably equipped systems, representing hundreds of dollars
of savings for our reseller customers.  In addition, AST systems
add value due to features such as SGRAM technology that other
companies don't even come close to matching,&quot; he added.
<P>
AST recently introduced its next generation of Bravo commercial
desktops with prices ranging from $1,250 for an entry-level Bravo
LC to $2,400 for a high-end, fully loaded Bravo MS desktop.  AST's
powerful Bravo MS 5166, for example, comes with a 166 MHz Pentium &#174;
processor, 2.0 GB hard drive, 16 MB EDO RAM, 6X CD-ROM drive and
1 MB SGRAM -- all for $2,400.  
<P>
 &quot;We have developed a solid, comprehensive pricing structure
that enables us to balance our inventory and product distribution
to optimal levels.  Unlike other PC vendors who are reacting,
we thought out our strategy and are executing to deliver to our
resellers and end-users,&quot; Diery stated.
<P>
AST's revised business strategy focuses on being first-to-market
with aggressively priced leading-edge technologies.  The company's
January implementation of this strategy resulted in being first
to deliver to the indirect channel Pentium&#174; Pro 150 MHz processor-based
solutions in the form of the Bravo MS-T 6150 commercial desktop.
<P>
Last month, AST claimed the honor of again being first-to-market
with the incorporation of Intel's fourth generation PCI chip,
the 430HX PCIset, into the spring line of Bravo MS commercial
desktops.
<P>
&quot;Some direct manufacturers would like resellers to believe
that they cannot quickly pass along component cost reductions
to their customers due to high levels of existing inventory,&quot;
said Diery.  &quot;We are proving this theory to be dead wrong
with our new Bravo systems.  Our spring products allow resellers
to deliver the fastest and most highly-configured desktop systems
to their customers at super aggressive prices.&quot;
<P>
Diery also noted that AST has been able to gauge and respond
to the needs of the reseller community by growing its inventory
turns.
<P>
&quot;Our inventory turns rate of 11.5, compared to a typical
target rate of about 7.5 turns per year, is evidence of our stringent
asset management and success in anticipating the needs of our
resellers,&quot; Diery continued.
<P>
AST believes that users and resellers today are extremely savvy
about what they want - power and performance without compromising
technology or value.  They want a return on investment that doesn't
sour in a year's time.  
<P>
&quot;Our new Bravo systems are designed to address these needs
and also allow users to move toward the twenty-first century without
having to worry about their PCs becoming obsolete,&quot; Diery
noted.
