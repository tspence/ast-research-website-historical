<B>IRVINE, Calif. - November 14, 1996</B>  --  AST&#174; Computer (NASDAQ:ASTA)
today announced its support for the new Intel motherboard form
factor specification, known as NLX.  Designed as a specification
to support current and future generations of processors as well
as advanced graphics and memory technologies, the NLX form factor
(size and shape) represents the latest step in Intel's Wired for
Management Initiative to further reduce computing costs.
<P>
&quot;We are committed to providing our customers with complete,
quick-to-market solutions designed to enhance their productivity
while reducing their total cost of system ownership,&quot; stated
AST's Laura Raybin, director of product planning, commercial systems.
&quot;With this latest technology from Intel, our customers will
reap benefits through cost-effective, easily serviced products.
We believe this new streamlined form factor represents a major
step forward in product development.&quot;
<P>
According to Intel, this newest form factor is designed to help
reduce the total cost of PC ownership, allowing for better access
to upgradable components and greater ease of installation.  The
NLX motherboard specification enables a variety of system implementations
ranging from low profile systems to desktops and minitowers.
<P>
Recognizing the importance of time-to-market, AST believes that
this new motherboard form factor from Intel provides an additional
building block designed to incorporate new technology quickly,
giving users a wider range of new features.
<P>
&quot;We believe that by developing a common platform for incorporating
new capabilities that address user computing needs, the NLX specification
allows us to provide additional flexibility in future PC system
design,&quot; Raybin added. 
<P>
AST will begin offering Bravo commercial desktops with the new
NLX form factor next year.   Recently awarded the prestigious
&quot;Recommended Buy&quot; accolade from <I>Windows Magazine</I>,
AST's Bravo commercial desktop series is designed as a complete
line of computing solutions for commercial desktop needs.  In
the November 1996 issue of <I>Windows Magazine</I>, the Bravo
MS-T 6200 garnered a coveted spot on the &quot;Recommended Buy&quot;
list.  According to the review,  &quot;The AST (Bravo MS-T 6200)
represents an extraordinary value.&quot;
