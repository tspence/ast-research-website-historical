<B>AST REINFORCES COMMITMENT TO CHANNEL WITH GROUND-BREAKING PRICES</B>
<P>
<B>Recent Competitor Price Slashings No Match For AST's Aggressively
Priced Notebooks and Desktops</B>
</CENTER>

IRVINE, Calif., July 29, 1996 -- Reinforcing its commitment to
the channel, AST Computer today announced that despite recent
price slashing activities by several major PC vendors, the company's
commercial desktops and notebooks remain as much as 25 percent
below similarly-equipped models from other PC players.
<P>
&quot;Our new streamlined business model gives us the flexibility
to quickly align and readjust our pricing,&quot; stated AST's
president and chief executive officer, Ian Diery.  &quot;We are
leveraging industry-wide component price reductions and passing
this savings onto our customers.  We are giving our VARS and resellers
a competitive response to both the direct and indirect models
from our competitors.&quot;
<P>
AST's new pricing announcement places desktop and notebook products
above par with competitor offerings, and in some cases, well below
major competitors with comparably-equipped systems.  
<P>
&quot;Some direct manufacturers would like resellers to believe
that channel players cannot quickly pass along component cost
reductions to their customers due to high levels of existing inventory,&quot;
said Diery.  &quot;We are proving this theory to be dead wrong
with our new Bravo and Ascentia systems.  Our newest products
allow resellers to deliver the fastest and most highly-configured
desktop and notebook systems to their customers at super aggressive
prices.&quot;
<P>
The recent price moves on AST's Bravo commercial desktops and
Ascentia notebooks can represent hundreds of dollars of savings
for reseller customers.  Additionally, AST's award-winning commercial
desktops and notebooks add tremendous value due to innovative
software and hardware features.
<P>
AST-CommandCenter&#153; for example, available on Bravo commercial
desktops, provides a level of system management virtually unmatched
by any other PC manufacturer today. 
<P>
Complete with hardware and software-based virus protection,
stringent security, DMI asset management, as well as remote diagnostic
capability, AST-CommandCenter adds up to reduced cost of ownership
and increased business efficiency.
<P>
Standard on Bravo MS-T Pro 6180 and 6200 minitowers is a special
AST-CommandCenter feature known as AST-IntraAccess, a first-of-a-kind
software bundle with network browsing and Web authoring tools.
AST-IntraAccess includes all of the software that one needs to
make sharing data via a company Intranet a breeze.
<P>
&quot;Our philosophy here at AST is quite simple - to be the
best friend to the reseller and VAR community - and to provide
them the utmost in price, performance and service,&quot; Diery
noted.  &quot;Our very aggressively-priced, award-winning lines
of commercial desktop and notebooks allow us to pass on these
values to them.&quot;

<BR>
The new Bravo commercial desktops come in several flavors, the
entry-level Bravo LC, a Pentium processor-based system, the mid-range
Bravo MS, also a Pentium processor-based system and the Pentium
Pro processor-based performance Bravo MS-T Pro minitower. 
<P>
AST's recently introduced next generation of Bravo commercial
desktops are propelled by the latest Intel&#174; Pentium and Pentium
Pro processor technologies and range in price from $1,300 for
an entry-level Bravo LC to $2,900 for a high-end, fully loaded
Bravo MS Pentium Pro processor-based minitower.   AST's powerful
Bravo MS-T Pro 6200, for example, comes with a 200MHz Pentium
Pro processor, 2.5 GB hard drive, 32MB RAM, 8X CD-ROM drive and
2MB WRAM -- all for about $2,900!

<U><B>Ascentia Notebooks </B></U>
<BR>
Featuring flexible, modular designs, superior battery life and
large crisp displays, AST's Ascentia notebooks are in a class
by themselves. 
<P>
&quot;Nowhere else will you find the feature set and level of
support at the price points that we offer in our newest notebooks,&quot;
Diery said.  &quot;Today, you can get our high-end Ascentia P50
-- a 133MHz Pentium processor-based system with a 1.2GB hard drive,
16MB standard RAM, integrated modular 4X CD-ROM and a SmartPoint
touch pad for $4,499 -- as much as 23 percent below comparably-equipped
notebooks from competitors!
<P>
AST believes that users and resellers today are extremely savvy
about what they want - power and performance without compromising
technology or value.  They want a return on investment that doesn't
sour in a year's time.  
<P>
&quot;Our new commercial desktop and notebook systems are designed
to address these needs and also allow users to move toward the
twenty-first century without worrying that their PCs will become
obsolete,&quot; Diery noted.
