IRVINE, Calif., June 4, 1996 -- Paving a smooth path for corporate
buyers to make early and strategic investments in Pentium&#174; Pro
desktop systems, AST Computer today announced that it will offer
its commercial customers an upgrade path to the next generation
of Microsoft&#174; Windows NT&#174; Workstation operating system, Windows
NT Workstation 4.0.
<P>
The offer is available to all customers who purchase AST's forthcoming
line of Intel Pentium Pro processor-based Bravo commercial desktops
which will use the current version of the Windows NT Workstation
operating system.  Customers purchasing the new Bravo Pentium
Pro processor-based systems running the current version of Windows
NT Workstation will be offered a coupon, good for an upgrade to
the new Windows NT Workstation 4.0 operating system at no charge.
According to Microsoft, the operating system is expected to be
available later this summer.
<P>
&quot;The corporate interest in Windows NT Workstation and 32-bit
applications is exploding,&quot; stated AST's Dan Sheppard, vice
president, worldwide product marketing.  &quot;What we have done
by offering our business users an easy upgrade path to Windows
NT Workstation 4.0 is to provide them with a compelling reason
to invest early in Pentium Pro processor-based PCs.  We are helping
our customers move into the twenty-first century without fear
of their PCs becoming obsolete.&quot;
<P>
The new Pentium Pro processor-propelled Bravo PCs, with estimated
street prices starting at a very aggressive $2,750, will ship
in early June and incorporate the new Intel 440FX PCIset designed
to provide business desktop users with high-powered, low-cost
solutions ideal for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation environments.
Designed to provide the horsepower for Windows NT Workstation
computing needs with the headroom to run 32-bit applications in
the future, the latest Bravo PCs help extend the life of a user's
hardware investment.

AST recognizes that corporate users are migrating to 32-bit software
environments such as Windows NT Workstation for higher performance
and greater network control and manageability.  Data from research
house Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII) indicates that Pentium
Pro technology combined with Windows NT Workstation will make
full use of 32-bit codes and applications.
<P>
 &quot;What this means to users is that the second half of 1996
will set the scene for an inferno of dramatic growth among Pentium
Pro users migrating to the Windows NT Workstation platform,&quot;
said Sheppard.  &quot;Our strong understanding of the needs of
the business community and anticipation of the Windows NT Workstation
inflection point lets us take advantage of being first-to-market
with the right product at the right time.
<P>
&quot;Users and resellers alike are extremely savvy about what
they want - and they want power and performance without a compromise
in technology or value. They want a return on investment (ROI)
that doesn't sour in a year's time,&quot; Sheppard noted.
