<FONT SIZE=2><P>Ascentia</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>&Ocirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> M Review&#9; </P>
</B><P>GREAT NEWS!! PC Portables just reviewed the new Ascentia M notebook in its November, 1997 issue (pp. 56-58) and found it so impressive that they awarded the cover to AST! (We are ordering glossy reprints and will distribute them as soon as possible.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Title: <I>"FAST, FAST...AST"</P>
</I><P>"<I>The first thing that caught my attention with the AST Ascentia M Series portable computer was its relatively light weight (just 6.2 pounds with the floppy installed) in relation to its slightly larger-than-normal form factor (12 inches wide). AST has managed to include a beautiful 13.3-inch screen on a machine that won't break your back when you carry it off to Comdex or tote it around from client to client to do your presentations.</P>
<P>But that's not all. Once I booted up this machine, I was astounded by the speed at which it moves. Its 233MHz Pentium</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>&Ograve;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor with MMX</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>&Ocirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> enhancement (formerly known as a Tillamook chip) makes this a machine that you don't have to wait for. Its boot-up time is among the fastest I've seen, and its 512KB of Level 2 cache further enhances the speed at which regularly used applications can be accessed. The package also includes a 56kbps integrated &lt;wrong!&gt; modem.</P>
</I><P>&lt;FYI - they did get the price wrong also.&gt; With a $5,999 price tag, AST is obviously targeting this machine to the deep-pocketed segment of the market, not to mention those who believe that every millisecond counts.&gt;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P>SCREEN AND KEYBOARD</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><I><P>"The 13.3 inch screen on the Ascentia M Series is a sight to behold. It provides plenty of viewing area, crisp color and is just plain impressive to see. I imagine that using this computer on an airplane could provoke some serious screen envy among fellow passengers. But on a more practical side, this screen will not let you down if you, like many portable users, do presentations on a regular basis. Boosting the computers video performance is 2MB of video memory."</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><P>"The keyboard on the Ascentia M Series is very smooth. Key feel is nearly perfect, with just the right amount of give in each key. The space bar is long enough at three inches, and is shaped wider in its center and tapered shorter on both ends. I never missed the space bar while typing, nor did I accidentally hit the touchpad when looking for the space bar. The touchpad resides just below the space bar on the palmrest area of the computer and features two mouse buttons. This touchpad is among the most precise and responsive on the market." </I>&lt;heh! heh! he said "responsive". heh!.. heheh!&gt;\</P>
<I><P>"The keyboard is very quiet in use, producing only a slight clicking sound when keys are depressed. Generally, it has a nice solid feel. My only beef with this keyboard is the size of the Delete key. It's placed on the top right row of keys, which can be adjusted to after some use, but it is a very small key. This is a frequently used key on most keyboards and should, in my opinion, rank as a full-sized key. There are two Windows 95 keys, placed on the right and left side of the space bar, and one Windows Menu key. Function keys are half-size and placed along the top of the keyboard."</P>
<P>"Another small beef I have is the size of the palmrest. At close to four inches, I found it a bit deep for typing comfort. Feet to elevate the rear of the computer would have helped, but the Ascentia M lacks these. The size of the palmrest is a subjective thing, and it is quite possible another user would be satisfied with this one. I suggest trying it out before buying."</P>
<P>"The palmrest area houses the system's two built-in speakers. The sound emanating from these speakers was on a par with many portable computer speakers but tended to get muffled a bit when I played music CDs while I was typing. In general, however, these speakers would be suitable for use during presentations."</I> </P>
<I><P>"Status lights are located on the left front edge of the palmrest area. These lights provide status on computer power; Num, Caps, and Scroll Locks, drive in use, and battery charge. The computer's on/off switch is located atop the keyboard on the right side."</P>
</I><B><P>CONNECTORS AND BAYS</P>
</B><I><P>"The computer's right side has only one connector, that for the AS adapter. Also residing on this side of the computer are a fan vent (the fan can be fairly loud at times), the hard drive compartment, a Kensington lock slot and the battery compartment. This model of the Ascentia M comes standard with a lithium ion battery, while lower-end models come with a nickel-metal hydride battery &lt;BUZZ! "Wrong answer. Thank you for playing"&gt;. Battery life was quite good; I received just over 3 1/2 hours."</P>
</I><B><P>IN OPERATION</P>
</B><I><P>"The Ascentia M Series loaded the hefty Office 97 suite faster than I've every seen before. I also loaded Road Trips Door to Door (from TravRoute Software, Princeton, New Jersey) and was impressed by the speed at which road maps were called up by the system. The CD-ROM drive performed flawlessly."</P>
<P>"This machine garnered a remarkable 58.9 on the Norton Utilities System Information test, far and away the highest score we have ever seen on a portable computer. That new Intel Mobile Chip apparently delivers the goods."</P>
<P>"This machine never ran hot; after close to seven hours of constant use, the bottom of the computer was only slightly warm to the touch. It is a comfortable machine to use on the lap; in fact, I preferred to use it this way because of the deep palm-rest. I found the typing angle more comfortable this way. And with the ample display of this computer, I found it very easy on my eyes, particularly when I zoomed up the type size a bit. If you spend a great deal of your day in front of a computer screen, I believe the Ascentia M Series will be kind to your eyes."</P>
</I><B><P>THE VERDICT</P>
</B><I><P>"The AST Ascentia M Series is a very impressive package. It delivers high performance at top speeds and would serve just about anyone's portable computing needs well. This speed and performance comes with a pretty high price tag, however, so the computer will be off-limits to many portable users. This is not surprising for one of the first Tillamook based portables out on the market and for a 13.3-inch display. For the more budget-minded, AST is also offering models in the Ascentia M Series for as little as $2,499.</P>
</I><B><P>WHAT'S IN A NAME?</P>
</B><I><P>"AST was acquired this past August by Samsung Electronics. Samsung decided at that time to merge its computer lines with those of AST and to market them under the AST name because of the acquired company's strong market presence. We will continue to see some Samsung computers over the next few months, but eventually we will only see the AST brand name on computers. AST will also provide support and service for Samsung computers."&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<B><P>Ascentia M Series PCMCIA Compatibility List on AST Website&#9;Shane Yarbrough, Darron Osborn</P>
</B><P>Forwarded email from your friends in Service Validation Test (SVT) re. Shane Yarbrough 10/20:</P>
<I><P>"I might as well take this as the opportunity to make an official announcement of how the PC Card compatibility lists came about and how to get to them. I had planned this to be a surprise for this week, but news certainly travels fast.</P>
<P>SVT has been in existence for some two years. During that time, one of the major requests that I have heard throughout this entire organization is the need for a list of cards tested with each product. When SVT began back in November, 1995, there were two folks in the group: one for Desktop/Server and myself for Mobile. Making such a compatibility list in SVT at that time would have been impossible from at least manpower and PC Card availability hurdles. </P>
<P>Now that SVT has grown to four folks total, and with the phase-out of the Advantage line, there are two folks for Desktop/Server and two folks for Mobile. The additional person has allowed more thorough testing than ever before, as well as the potential for the creation of such PC Card compatibility lists as Bob Bennett speaks of.</P>
<P>Darron Osborn and I realized no one had "stepped up to the plate" to commit to test and publish detailed/useful information in the form of a PC Card compatibility list, so we felt it important to do as much as possible to accomplish this task. I must say that this task was accomplished because of Darron. He did 95% of the whole job. It is him who we should thank for creating the form and spending weeks searching for drivers and firmware, and talking to vendors. It takes a lot to stick your neck out there and publish detailed information of this nature for public consumption, and I personally applaud his work.</P>
<P>As of now, the PC Card lists can be found at:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><P ALIGN="CENTER">WIN95 (AST HDI 490263-001)</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">http://www.ast.com/products/ascentia/chart/m_pcard_95.html</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER">WINNT4.0 AST HDI 490211-001)</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">http://www.ast.com/products/ascentia/chart/m_pcard_NT.html</P>
</U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>With all the new BIOS chips, we have found some anomalies with a couple of cards on the attached list. The modifications will be posted soon. Darron and I feel the PC Cards lists are living documents, and we will provide updates for significant modifications we find here or can verify as reported by others. </P>
<P>We plan on a smaller matrix for Win3.X and DOS6.22 for Mirror. We are also in the process of a compatibility matrix for Donald Dock. We just need to get all these BIOS changes settled down."</P>
</I><P>What dedication you have shown, Shane and Darron. Thank you so much for your efforts.</P>
<B><P>Departure of Terry Prescott, Marketing Programs Manager</P>
</B><P>Some of you may already know, but Terry Prescott recently left AST to do that old "pursue exciting new opportunities" thang. If anything is needed, feel free to contact the remaining Mobile Brand Team of me, myself, and I. Please join me in wishing Terry good luck in her new endeavor.</P>

</B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A New Ovation! Program is coming soon. The Ovation! Program was developed to enhance our relationship with key resellers who wish to partner with AST. Now AST is taking that concept a step further by offering a new and improved program. The Ovation! Program will soon offer three levels of support that will correspond with the commitment made by the reseller. Below is a sneak peek:</P>
<U><P>Program</U> &#9;&#9;&#9;<U>Criteria</U>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<U>Number of Resellers</P>
</U><P>Ovation! Platinum&#9;$2 million in AST sales annually&#9;&#9;&#9;               200&#9;</P>
<P>Ovation! Gold&#9;&#9;$120,000 to $2 million in AST sales annually&#9;&#9;800</P>
<P>Ovation! Silver&#9;&#9;Less than $120,000 in AST sales annually&#9;&#9;               Thousands</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>AST/Samsung Media Tour, 1997</P>
</B><P>Fifteen editors and analysts from the U.S., Canada and Australia participated in a two and a half day media trip to Seoul, Korea (September 22-24, 1997). Sponsored by AST and Samsung, the media trip was designed as a vehicle for educating key media to the "New AST" as part of the Samsung family. Additionally, the media tour functioned as a relationship-building vehicle for both Samsung and AST executives. </P>
<P>Bottom line, this tour resulted in an improved perception of AST by the media, with coverage by more than half a dozen key publications. And even more importantly, the tour enhanced relationships between our most influential critics and AST/Samsung.</P>
<B><P>Editorial Tour of AST Texas - Service and Support</P>
</B><P>During the week of October 27, four key editors from top tier publications and two AST representatives will travel to AST Bluemound to tour the manufacturing and service and support facilities, meet with service program managers as well as service and support executives, and attend presentations on new service programs and improvements (hold time, spare parts turnaround, etc.) The objective of this tour is to give influential editors a better understanding of the great strides AST is making in its service commitment to customers. Stay tuned to the next Marketing Update for the results of this very important tour.</P>
