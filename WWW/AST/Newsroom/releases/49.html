IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 23, 1996 - In a move that continues to assert
its aggressive new consumer retail strategy, AST Computer today
introduced the Ascentia A Series of multimedia-ready notebook
computers, which break all traditional price, performance and
functionality boundaries.  Each model in this new series of value-right,
feature-rich notebook computers comes complete with a 120MHz Intel
Pentium processor, a vivid color display, a 1GB hard drive, 16MB
of standard RAM, a fast 6X CD-ROM and a spectrum of advanced features.
Priced from $2,499, the Ascentia A Series is perfectly suited
for SOHO and home users or for value-oriented corporate customers
who want to defy obsolescence and protect their computing investment.
<P>
&quot;The consumer retail market has become increasingly sensitive
of how the rapid advancements in computing technology can impact
their notebook PC investment,&quot; said Mark Marlow, director,
mobile product marketing for AST Computer.  &quot;As a result,
users are seeking affordable solutions that offer higher performance
and state-of-the-art features that won't become obsolete overnight.
The Ascentia A Series delivers the power and complete multimedia
functionality users need to protect their investment - without
added costs for features they're not likely to use.&quot;
<P>
<U><B>Feature-Smart, Value-Wise</B></U>
<BR>
The Ascentia A Series was designed from the ground up to include
everything users need for high-performance mobile computing and
multimedia, and nothing they don't.  Customers can be assured
that one of the two Ascentia A models will precisely match both
their computing and budget requirements.  
<P>
The new value-oriented notebooks each offer a 120MHz Intel Pentium
processor, a 1GB hard drive and 16MB of standard RAM expandable
to 80MB. The Ascentia A Series also offers an exceptionally vibrant
12.1-inch Super VGA TFT or an 11.3-inch Super VGA DSTN color screen.
 <I>(See attached chart for a detailed outline of models and features.)</I>
<P>
<U><B>Dynamic Multimedia, Anywhere </B></U>
<BR>
The Ascentia A Series' advanced, built-in multimedia capabilities
allow users to develop multimedia presentations, play CD-ROM games,
watch full-screen movies, or just listen to their favorite music
- at their desk or on the go.  The Ascentia A Series comes complete
with 1MB of video memory, software-based MPEG, 16-bit Sound Blaster&#174;
audio, zoomed video support and dual stereo speakers.  For external
attachment, the systems also include a speaker-out port, line-in
port and microphone-in port.  
<P>
The Ascentia A Series also includes a high-performance, modular
6X CD-ROM drive.  Using AST's unique SmartBay accessory bay, users
can easily switch between the CD-ROM and standard 1.44MB floppy
drive within just a few seconds.
<P>
<U><B>Mobile Computing with Convenience</B></U>
<BR>
At a mere 6.75 pounds with a floppy drive installed or just 7.0
pounds when housing a CD-ROM drive, Ascentia A Series notebooks
are exceptionally portable.  Windows&#174; 95 comes pre-installed
and the Ascentia A Series features an advanced full-size keyboard
design that provides a wide palm rest area.  Using the SmartPoint
Touchpad pointing device, files saved on an Ascentia A Series
system open with just a tap of a finger.  
<P>
The enhanced nickel-metal hydride battery included with Ascentia
A Series products provides more than two hours of battery life.
Because the unit is compatible with a Duracell DR36 NiMh Smart
battery, additional batteries can be easily purchased.  For added
convenience, the Ascentia A Series' built-in infrared port allows
files to be sent and received from any IrDA compliant computer
or printer.  For maximum expandability, the Ascentia A Series
supports one Type 3 or two Type 2 PC Cards.  
<P>
The Ascentia A Series can also be quickly transformed into a desktop
system through the use of the optional Mini-Dock port replicator
unit.  The Mini-Dock, which remains on a user's desk pre-connected
to a desktop PC monitor, mouse, external keyboard and printer
and the network, enables quick connection and disconnection for
ultimate computing flexibility. 
<P>
<U><B>Retail Channel Availability</B></U>
<BR>
The Ascentia A Series is available now from leading computer
super stores, consumer electronics stores and mass merchants.
The new notebook series is additionally available by mail-order.
<P>
AST Computer also offers the Ascentia J20, a low-cost notebook
ideal for students and SOHO users that don't require multimedia
capabilities; and the Ascentia P line of professional notebooks
