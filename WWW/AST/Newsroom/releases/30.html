<b>AST<sup>&#174;</sup> COMPUTER'S NEW PC TRADE-IN PROGRAM<BR>
SAVES BUSINESSES TIME AND MONEY, KEEPS TECHNOLOGY CURRENT</b><BR>
</center>
<P>
IRVINE, Calif., July, 23, 1997 &#150; As the technology curve continues to accelerate, more and more businesses are looking for ways to provide their employees with the latest PC features and technologies, while retiring their old, outdated systems in a cost-effective, environmentally-safe way.<BR>
<P>
Towards this end, AST Computer today announced a unique personal computer trade-in program and asset recovery service that allows businesses to purchase new technologies while maximizing their budget.<BR>
<P>
Designed for customers who are looking to retire 25 or more PC's, migrating to Windows '95 or Windows NT operating systems and planning to purchase 50 or more new PC's, AST's trade-in program is an easy, efficient and EPA-compliant method to retire outdated desktop, notebook and server assets, as well as monitors, printers, facsimile machines and other peripherals.<BR>
<P>
&#34;Our new trade-in program is unique in the PC industry and supports our goal to be the responsive to customer needs regarding lowering the total cost of computer ownership,&#34; said Scott Bower, senior vice president, Americas.  &#34;Similar in concept to trading in your automobile on the latest model, we have developed a quick and efficient way to recycle old systems, regardless of brand.  Because approximately 60 percent of PCs sold to businesses are used to replace older equipment, our new program can help IS departments save considerable time, money and storage space.&#34;<BR>
<P>
AST's trade-in program is simple to use.  The process begins with a toll-free phone call to AST requesting a trade-in inventory form.  After receiving a list of the equipment to be traded-in via fax, AST will return a quote with the estimated value of the used equipment within five business days.  Once approved by the customer, personnel from AST's Asset Recovery Service &#40;ARS&#41; will arrange all logistics to pack up the retired equipment and ship  it to the ARS testing facility.  The ARS facility will test the used systems and peripherals for functionality to confirm their final value. Additionally, ARS staff will erase all hard disks to clear company confidential data and any remaining software to eliminate infringement of original software licenses.<BR>
<P>
ARS can also help business avoid potentially-expensive EPA violations by providing destruction certificates acknowledging proper removal and disposal of the hazardous materials contained in both PC's and monitors, such as mercury and lead.  Most companies don't realize that these materials must be handled by a licensed Hazardous Waste Refiner and disposed of in EPA-designated hazardous waste landfills.<BR>
<P>
&#34;We are confident our PC trade-in service will become increasingly popular as businesses look for more ways to maximize the value of their IS dollar and free up their IS resources  to perform more productive tasks,&#34; added Bower.  &#34;In many cases, we are finding that companies do not know the real cost of Asset Retirement and Disposition  and their potential exposure to EPA fines.  With our program, we're there to help solve a time-consuming business problem that pays off with new, productivity-enhancing hardware.&#34;<BR>
