<P>
IRVINE, Calif., April 22, 1996 -- Arming its customers with innovative,
hot new technologies and value-rich solutions at great prices
for their commercial desktop needs, AST today unleashed its spring
line of  Pentium&#174; processor-based Bravo commercial PCs.  Designated
Bravo LC and Bravo MS, the latest family members combine a host
of new hardware and software features designed to make everyone
sit up and take notice.
<P>
&quot;Our Bravo PCs personify our commitment to be first-to-market
with the latest technology at truly aggressive prices,&quot; stated
Ian Diery, president and chief executive officer of AST Computer.
 &quot;We have pushed the limits of PC performance to take advantage
of today's demanding and data-intensive applications as well as
those of tomorrow's 32-bit environments.  With our Bravo PCs,
customers are given the hallmark of insurance through superb performance
and enhanced productivity.&quot;
<P>
With these latest commercial desktop offerings, AST reinforces
its quick-to-market strategy that it began earlier this year with
the introduction of the Intel Pentium Pro&#174; architecture for its
high-end Bravo commercial desktops.  In this crop of Bravo PCs,
AST takes desktop management to new heights with AST-CommandCenter
and its software partnership with Intel.  Incorporating Intel's
LANDesk&#174; technology, network management is made simpler.
<P>
&quot;By incorporating elements of Intel's LanDesk product technology,
the new AST Bravo systems will help users reduce support costs
and increase system effectiveness,&quot; said Terry Dickson, business
unit manager at Intel's Network Product Division.  &quot;With
this capability, AST is demonstrating its commitment to delivering
manageable systems.&quot;
<P>
Also this year, AST spiraled technical service for business to
new heights with AST-LifeLine&#153;, a remote diagnostic capability
that combines voice and data over an ordinary phone line.
<P>
&quot;The commercial desktop world is vastly different from two
years ago when systems were purchased for the needs of the moment,&quot;
stated Dan Sheppard, vice president of desktop and server product
marketing.
<P>
&quot;Users and resellers today are extremely savvy about what
they want - and they want power and performance without a compromise
in technology or value.  They want a return on investment (ROI)
that doesn't sour in a year's time.  Our Bravo LC and MS systems
fulfill these needs and also allow users to move into the twenty-first
century without having to worry about their PCs becoming obsolete,&quot;
he added.
<P>
<U><B>Meeting Today's Needs With Tomorrow In Mind</B></U><BR>
AST recognizes that today's business applications are increasingly
data-base heavy, demanding more graphics, video and virtual memory.
 Users need systems designed specifically for these more sophisticated
applications.  AST believes that 32-bit applications and robust
operating systems will rapidly become the standard for the commercial
desktop world.
<P>
&quot;We have designed our systems to meet these anticipated
application needs, to expand and grow and maximize your investment
dollars for years to come,&quot; noted Sheppard.
<P>
<U><B>A Wise Investment</B></U><BR>
The new Bravo family is a streamlined, Pentium processor-based
lineup with the horsepower and features that make it a wise technology
investment for the heart of the commercial market.  The latest
Bravo desktops and minitowers boast three Pentium processors:
100MHz to 133MHz to 166MHz.  
<P>
This new simplified product strategy features three hard drives
with configurations of 630MB, 1.2GB and 2.0GB hard drives.  CPU
subsystems scream with 16MB of faster EDO RAM with parity capabilities
and synchronous burst cache.  Select models come standard with
a 6X CD-ROM drive.
<P>
All new Bravo systems come with dual-install capability for MS-DOS&#174;
6.22/Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows&#174; 95.  Appendices I and
II list the key features and pricing for each of the new Bravo
family members.
<P>
<U><B>Revolutionary Desktop Management: New Heights With AST-CommandCenter</B></U><BR>
 AST pushes the boundaries of desktop management with a suite 
of software utilities called AST-CommandCenter that is available on all new spring Bravo models.
 With AST-CommandCenter, software utilities are not just good
for the user, they benefit the whole corporation. 
<P>
 &quot;AST-CommandCenter gives new meaning to value by providing
IS managers with more power, more information and more control
- all at their fingertips,&quot; Sheppard stated.
<P>
Complete with hardware and software-based virus protection, stringent
security, DMI asset management, as well as remote diagnostic capability,
AST-CommandCenter adds up to reduced cost of ownership and increased
business efficiency.
<P>
New features to this third generation of AST-CommandCenter include
AST-RemoteQuery which is a remote engine that powers real-time
access to DMI-compliant networked PCs.  Using Intel's LANDesk
technology and Networked Software inventory that allows for tracking
and reporting on system hardware, configurations and up to 4,000
software titles, IS managers are given the ability to efficiently
and effectively manage their Bravo networks. 
<P>
&quot;Imagine that you are an IS manager, responsible for the
maintenance of 4,000 systems and you need to upgrade all of them
to Windows NT&#153;.  Using AST-RemoteQuery, you can get a real-time
listing of all systems for example, that currently have only 8MB
of RAM, and which version of Microsoft Windows&#174; is installed -
and simplify your life in a matter of minutes,&quot; noted Sheppard.
<P>
<U><B>Bravo MS Systems Give New Meaning To Technology Investment</B></U><BR>
This spring, the Bravo MS receives a facelift.  Combining new
advanced core logic from Intel with higher performance memory
and an accelerated graphic subsystem, AST is challenging the industry
