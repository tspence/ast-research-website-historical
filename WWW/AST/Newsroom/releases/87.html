<B>AST REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 1, 1996 -- AST Research, Inc. (ASTA-NASDAQ)
today announced revenues of $553.7 million for the second quarter
of fiscal year 1996, ended June 29.  This compares with revenues
of $662.0 million reported during the comparable prior year period
and $530.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 1996.
<P>
The company reported a net loss of $98.7 million, or net loss
per share of $2.21 during the second quarter of fiscal year 1996,
compared to a net loss of $31.6 million and net loss per share
of 98 cents reported during the prior year period.  The net loss
includes charges of $13.6 million, or approximately 30 cents per
share, including $6.5 million that was taken as part of the company's
previously-announced worldwide restructuring activities and $7.1
million of other charges.
<P>
&quot;Second quarter performance, excluding the $13.6 million
in charges, improved by $30.6 million when compared with the immediately
preceding quarter, indicating that our efforts to grow market
share and return to profitability are definitely moving in the
right direction,&quot; said Ian Diery, president and chief executive
officer.  &quot;We grew revenues in the U.S. sequentially which
resulted in a domestic market share increase and the re-establishment
of AST as a top 10 PC supplier.&quot;
<P>
Improved internal processes that were established months earlier
began to achieve results during the second quarter.  &quot;We
made further progress towards our goals of being first to market
with new technologies, maintaining aggressive pricing levels relative
to direct manufacturers and improved quality and customer satisfaction
levels within the company's service and support operations, said
Diery.  &quot;AST also maintained tight asset management controls
which resulted in above-average inventory turn levels, as well
as a six percentage point gross margin improvement from the preceding
quarter.&quot;
<P>
Worldwide revenues for the second quarter included sales of $538.7
million, as well as $15 million that was received from Samsung
as part of a previously-announced intellectual property assignment
agreement.  Worldwide sales represented a 19 percent decrease
from the prior year period, and a four percent increase over first
quarter.  Lower year-over-year sales in the quarter was primarily
caused by sluggish international performance.
<P>
Sales of $337.9 million in the Americas represented a four percent
decline over the prior-year period but a 30 percent increase when
compared to the immediately preceding quarter.  Sales within the
company's Europe and Asia Pacific regions declined 35 percent
over the prior year's quarter and were 23 percent lower versus
last quarter.
<P>
&quot;On a sequential basis, we've shown dramatic improvement
in domestic sales, due largely from having the right mix of leading-edge
products available at aggressive price points which are typically
at or below those of direct PC manufacturers like Dell and Gateway,&quot;
said Diery.  &quot;With this as a foundation, we've used aggressive
advertising and other brand awareness efforts to enhance customer
knowledge about the outstanding value that our products represent
across the desktop, notebook and server platforms.&quot;
<P>
Unit shipments during the second quarter totaled approximately
321,000, comprised of 274,000 desktops and 47,000 notebooks. 
The total represented a decline of approximately 19 percent over
the prior year period and an increase of seven percent when compared
sequentially.  Total second quarter notebook shipments decreased
13 percent over last year's second quarter but were 57 percent
higher as compared sequentially.
<P>
&quot;Despite tough competition, executing on our strategy has
resulted in a significant jump in domestic unit shipments during
the second quarter,&quot; said Diery.   &quot;AST has returned
as a top 10 PC company due to increases in business desktop and
notebook systems, as well as the success of our sub-$1,000 PCs
that are selling at Wal-Mart.&quot;
<P>
<B>Balance Sheet Summary</B>
<BR>
During the second quarter, AST sustained its sharp focus on improving
its balance sheet and maintaining prudent inventory management.
<P>
At June 29, 1996, total cash and cash equivalents were $66.9
million, with $95.0 million in short-term borrowings against a
$200 million credit line.  Total net inventory was $218.1 million,
up from $190.4 million at Mar. 30 and represented inventory turns
of 9.8.  Accounts receivable totaled $387.5 million, which represented
63 days sales outstanding.
<P>
In July, the company repaid its $90 million three-year promissory
note to Tandy Corp. utilizing $30 million in newly issued common
stock and $60 million in cash.  Cash paid to Tandy was advanced
to AST by Samsung, which resulted in Samsung receiving approximately
8.5 million shares of newly-issued AST stock.
<P>
&quot;Samsung and AST will continue to closely monitor the potential
need that AST may have for further financial support from Samsung,&quot;
said Kwang Ho Kim, AST chairman and Samsung Electronics vice chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
<P>
<B>Second Quarter Summary</B>
<BR>
During the quarter, AST made significant improvements
in its strategic direction of being first to market with leading-edge
products, maintaining short and flexible supply lines, becoming
the best and most reliable supplier to the indirect channel and
becoming the company of choice to supply product worldwide.
<P>
AST's first to market strategy resulted in the industry's first
shipments of Bravo business desktops based on 200 MHz Intel Pentium&#174;
processors, Manhattan servers and Bravo business desktops based
on 180 MHz and 200 MHz Pentium Pro processors and Ascentia mobile
systems based on Intel's 100 MHz and 133 MHz Pentium processors.
In the consumer channel, the company was first to ship Advantage!
desktop systems with 200 MHz Pentium processors and 
8X CD-ROM drives, as well as breaking the $1,000 price barrier
for a complete multimedia system with monitor.  AST was also first
to begin a unique notebook service program with Federal Express,
called Express ONE, which enables overnight notebook system exchanges,
anywhere nationwide, to ensure maximum user productivity and minimum
downtime.
<P>
To further enhance the company's ability to speed products to
market, AST recently enhanced its product development processes,
including design verification testing, reliability testing and
other prototype engineering activities.  Working through these
processes with increased engineering resources is expected to
result in product designs that are more efficiently manufactured,
which will save additional time.  In addition, teams from AST
and Samsung are now implementing joint procurement, product development
and manufacturing efficiency projects which are designed to leverage
the combined strengths of both company's resources.
<P>
AST is also in the process of significantly enhancing its research
and development efforts, including an expansion of its product
development and engineering staff housed in Irvine.  In total,
more than 80 positions are to be added in the current quarter
which will allow the company to more quickly adapt to changing
market requirements and expand into new areas, better implement
concurrent product designs and enhance other systems-related activities.
The majority of the benefits of additional research and development
resources are not expected to be realized until 1997.
<P>
Working closely with its major vendors, AST has established short
and flexible supply lines which are beneficial to quickly adapt
to changes in customer demand.  Just-in-time (JIT) delivery and
closely-coupled vendor ordering and forecasting programs are among
the worldwide activities that AST is utilizing to enhance flexibility.
In addition, the company has begun development of SAP systems
in its European operations to more closely orchestrate regional
sales, manufacturing and procurement activities.  The company's
efforts in Europe are part of a two-year program which will result
in worldwide SAP implementation.
<P>
Resellers and end users are beginning to notice AST's efforts
in becoming the best and most reliable supplier to the indirect
channel.  AST has received positive feedback regarding its product
and pricing strategy that helps resellers compete against direct
marketers.  This also has assisted AST in achieving its goal of
recruiting an additional 400 domestic resellers.  In addition,
the company's increased emphasis on service and support has resulted
in an increase in responsiveness to technical support phone calls
and speed in spare parts shipments which are now operating at
best-in-class levels.
<P>
AST also achieved progress towards its efforts to become the
company of choice to supply product worldwide.  During the quarter,
the company laid the groundwork that will allow companies, both
domestic and internationally-based, to purchase PCs on a worldwide
basis by establishing and staffing a major accounts group that
will target companies with global operations.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<BR>
&quot;We have started to turnaround and have seen significant
progress in the U.S.,&quot; said Diery.  &quot;Our foundation
is more stable than last quarter, which we expect will act as
a catalyst for more positive future results.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Our plans for the remainder of the year are to maintain
consistency in bringing new technologies to market in advance
of competitors, while working with our strategic partner towards
expanding market share in the commercial desktop and notebook
arenas.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Long-term, we aim to continue our efforts to associate
first-to-market and AST together in the minds of our customers,&quot;
said Diery.  &quot;One extremely important short-term goal is
to pave a smooth path for corporate buyers to make early and strategic
investments in Pentium Pro systems that will utilize the benefits
of the Microsoft's recently-announced Windows&#174; NT 4.0 operating
system.  In the consumer market, we see communication and networking
as the next trend and will take action to be the first company
premiering several useful technologies, including video conferencing,
for home and home office users.&quot;
