IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 1, 1996 -- Reinforcing AST Computer's (NASDAQ:
ASTA) commitment to customer satisfaction, the 1996 AST Advantage!
Owner Survey reveals that 97 percent of Advantage! owners are
happy with their desktop computer purchase and give AST a strong
approval rating.  The survey results also confirm that three quarters
of Advantage! users who utilize technical support give AST's support
group a solid recommendation.  Additionally, the survey indicates
a nearly 60 percent increase in online service subscriptions obtained
by Advantage! PC users.
<P>
&quot;The 1996 AST Advantage! Owner Survey clearly indicates
that new owners of Advantage! desktop computers are very pleased
with their purchase.  The most often cited areas of approval were
price, features, power/performance, software bundles, quality,
ease of set-up, ease of use and especially AST's service and support,&quot;
said Cory Schwartz, president of ConsumerQuest, an independent
Los Angeles-based market research company that conducted the survey
of over 1000 Advantage! owners.  &quot;For example, one interesting
finding is that 97 percent of those who contacted AST for technical
support said that they were happy with their desktop system.&quot;

<BR>
The 1996 Advantage! Owners Survey indicates remarkable satisfaction
ratings from current owners of Advantage! multimedia desktop computers.
Of the 97 percent reporting a strong approval rating, 30 percent
said &quot;they loved it&quot; and another 48 percent said &quot;they
really like it.&quot;   These results are similar to a 1995 survey
which also confirmed that Advantage! owners were pleased with
the decision they had made in choosing AST.  In addition, 92 percent
said they would recommend AST to a friend.
<P>
&quot;From a company perspective, we are very pleased with the
results from this survey because it indicates that we are listening
to our customers and sales channels to produce Advantage! computing
solutions that our users require and appreciate,&quot; explained
Terry Baker, director of marketing for AST's worldwide consumer
products.
<P>
<U><B>Stellar Service and Support</B></U>
<BR>
AST Advantage! technical service and support received high praise
and recommendations from the survey respondents based on a number
of different programs that are available to Advantage! users.
This includes a toll-free hot-line for users in the United States,
available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Additionally, all
Advantage! PCs come equipped with AST-LifeLine&#153;, an interactive
technical support system that incorporates integrated voice and
data protocol with custom AST technical support software.  The
survey indicated that over 50 percent of Advantage! technical
support users utilize AST-LifeLine.  
<P>
Other support tools available to Advantage! users include the
AST InfoLINE (an automated voice response unit), an electronic
bulletin board service, AST Info-FAX (a 24-hour voice-automated
fax-response product information source), AST On-Line! (an extensive
on-line support available 24 hours a day, seven days a week) and
AST's own bulletin board service.
<P>
&quot;AST is committed to providing customers with the highest
level of support and service, which is why we emphasize the development
of new programs to better meet the needs of our customers,&quot;
said Matt Doyle, AST's vice president of service and support for
the Americas. &quot;For example, our customers wanted an interactive
technical support system to provide immediate support requirements.
We answered that need and are very pleased that over 50 percent
of our Advantage! technical support customers are utilizing AST-LifeLine.&quot;

In sync with the migrational trend toward the Internet, the Advantage!
Owner Survey revealed that there was a 50 percent increase in
online service subscriptions among Advantage! owners from 1995
to 1996.  AST expected this growth last year and planned accordingly
by bundling popular online software and other user-friendly features
to make accessing the Internet and online services easier and
fun for Advantage! users.
<P>
&quot;Accessing and communicating via online services is a big
growth area and one that AST will continue to address.  The survey
results reinforce that foresight, indicating that approximately
60 percent of users who purchased an Advantage! system went online
within two weeks of the purchase,&quot; explained Terry Baker.
&quot;By addressing these online needs and other customer requirements,
AST is clearly targeting our products accurately, which is resulting
in an exceptional customer satisfaction rating.&quot;
