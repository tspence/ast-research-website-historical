<P><CENTER><B>AST<SMALL>&REG;</SMALL> COMPUTER SUPPORTS TECHNOLOGY's BEST
WITH <BR>
PLANS TO INCLUDE INTEL's&REG; LATEST 440LX AGPSET</B></CENTER></P>

<P><I>AST Sets New Standard in Performance as it Prepares to Incorporate
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</A>'s&REG; New 440LX Advanced Graphics
Port into Bravo MS Commercial Desktops</I></P>

<P><B>IRVINE, Calif., August 25, 1997</B> - Continuing to surpass customers'
needs for computing solutions that increase productivity, AST Computer today
announced that its Bravo MS line of corporate desktop computers will include
Intel's new core logic chipset, the 440LX AGPset.<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/pc-supp/platform/agfxport/">
Intel's 440LX AGPset</A> features a faster graphics bus, for richer and
more complex graphics textures, with the ability to use system main memory
when necessary, a key advantage for the high-performance user. </P>

<P>Other &quot;first-time&quot; features enabled by the 440LX AGPset on
the upcoming Bravo MS <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/pentiumII/home.htm">Pentium&REG;
II processor</A>-based systems include improved memory speed with SDRAM
and faster IDE transfer rates with UltraDMA-33 hard disk drive. Additionally,
the Bravo MS desktops will include hardware support for a power management
feature called Advanced Configuration Power Interface (ACPI) which allows
desktop users to have the same &quot;suspend/resume&quot; mode as notebook
users.</P>

<P>&quot;Once again AST reinforces its commitment to delivering innovative
technology solutions by including the Intel 440LX AGPset in our upcoming
line of Bravo MS commercial desktop computers,&quot; confirmed Laura Raybin,
AST's director of Brand Marketing. &quot;Teaming with Intel allows us to
continue providing superior systems by implementing the latest in computing
technology.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Advantages of AGP Technology</B><BR>
The AGP implementation provides a dedicated point-to-point connection between
AGP and the 440LX core logic, delivering a transfer rate of up to 133 MHz.
With the dedicated point-to-point AGP connection, the PCI bus is no longer
burdened by graphics intensive computing. The AGP provides for scaleable
graphics and will use the main memory system when necessary, providing four
times the increase in bandwith over PCI-based graphics.</P>

<P>Additionally, DIrect Memory Execute (DIME) of textures through the AGP
port reduces contention with the CPU and I/O devices for bus memory access.
Intel's newest design allows graphics to utilize two buses, one that feeds
instructions from the processor and another that provides graphics textures
stored in main memory. The extra port to the graphics chip for memory access
allows for concurrent read-in of textures from the AGP while reading and
writing Z-values and pixels from local memory, in turn, allowing the CPU
to write directly to system memory. With AGP, the PCI bus is used exclusively
by non-graphic related peripherals such as HDD, CD-ROM, and Ethernet.</P>

<P><B>Unrivaled Service</B><BR>
AST stands behind each and every system sold by supporting its products
with a host of multi-source support programs. These quality service programs
include a toll-free hot-line for users in the United States, available 24
hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week. Users can access the electronic bulletin
board service for up-to-date system information (1-817-230-6850).</P>

<P>Service and technical support information is posted on the AST World
Wide Web site, (<A HREF="http://www.ast.com/">http://www.ast.com</A>) including
Web Support, a feature that allows users to e-mail questions from the Web
site directly to the AST online support team. Web service elements include
a list of the most frequently asked questions, software and technical bulletins,
and an index of files and drivers that can be easily downloaded.</P>

<P><B>Availability</B><BR>
AST will unveil the newest members of the Bravo MS family of desktop computers
in mid-September, 1997.</P>
