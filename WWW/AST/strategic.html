			developing and producing the new technologies of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century,” said S.T. Kim, AST president and
			chief executive officer and head of Samsung’s global PC operations.&nbsp; “As a world leader in semiconductors,
			displays and other computer technologies, Samsung will use AST as the front runner for linking the various Samsung
			Electronics divisions together to leverage Samsung’s diversity and vision of being a total solutions provider.
			As a total solutions provider, Samsung will integrate products and services from the company’s numerous technology
			divisions&nbsp; which include computers, semiconductors, consumer electronics, communications equipment and software,
			to deliver new and unique offerings for business and home users worldwide.<BR>
			<BR>
			“<I>We will witness a change in both our business and personal lifestyles as the digital revolution takes hold.&nbsp;
			We believe that together, AST and Samsung are poised for tremendous growth in these areas</I>,” said Kim.<BR>
			<BR>
			AST’s vision is to be a leading information technology solutions provider, ensuring that its customers succeed
			in the ever-evolving world of information technology. The company’s mission<B> </B>is twofold: to be the most responsive
			company in the PC industry by enabling customers to achieve their goals and to surpass customer expectations for
			technology, timeliness, quality and service. AST’s long-term goals include becoming the industry’s leading information
			technology provider and being one of the world’s top five PC suppliers by 2005.&nbsp; To accomplish this, the company’s
			short and medium-term activities involve aggressive product development and marketing targeted to both large corporations
			and small to medium-sized businesses.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<I>“We have created a new AST,” </I>said Kim<I>.&nbsp; “Stability, a return to profitability and being the industry’s
			most responsive company are the goals for the remainder of this year and throughout 1998.&nbsp; Once this is achieved,
			we will focus on growth by continuing to deliver better value to customers than our competitors. In addition, to
			satisfy volatile customer needs in a timely manner, we are reducing our order-to-delivery cycles as a result of
			more efficient manufacturing operations.&nbsp; By the year 2000, we plan to proliferate our server business in
			the multimedia network environment and expand our business in the consumer sector with convergence products such
			as PC Theater.&nbsp; From these efforts, we expect to regain market share and expand within a new emerging market
			as an industry leader.”</I><BR>
<BR>
AST’s aggressive product development efforts will be supported by significantly increasing the company’s R&amp;D
			investments.&nbsp; Plans call for doubling the R&amp;D budget by 1999 and quadrupling spending by 2001. In focusing
			on the commercial segment, AST will differentiate its business desktop systems to meet specific geographical and
			functional needs.&nbsp; Future desktop designs will employ a modular design to support the company’s new build-to-order
			strategy.<BR>
			<BR>
			For notebooks, AST will utilize Samsung’s vast resources in flat-panel displays, hard disk drives, memory and other
			components to produce high-end and mid-range systems with the latest and most popular features.<BR>
<BR>
For servers, AST has significantly increased its activities to focus on application servers for the Internet and
			networked PCs.&nbsp; The company will soon expand its server development team in order to enhance its development
			efforts and broaden the scope of the company’s product offerings.<BR>
<BR>
Each of these products is backed by industry-leading service and support plans that are among the industry’s most
			responsive.&nbsp; For example, calls to AST’s U.S. telephone support centers have had an average call pick up time
			of under one minute.&nbsp; The company also offers the industry’s only overnight notebook PC replacement through
			an arrangement with Federal Express. AST backs all of its products with a host of multi-source support programs
			including a toll-free “hot” line for users in the United States. All product warranty and technical information
			is also available through AST InfoLINE, an automated voice response unit (800-727-1278).&nbsp; Users can tap the
			electronic bulletin board service for a myriad of information (1-817-230-6850).&nbsp; AST Info-FAX, a 24-hour local
			and international voice-automated fax-response product information source, lets users download product information
			(800-926-1278). Extensive on-line support is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through AST On-Line!,
			AST’s own bulletin board service.&nbsp; CompuServe (GO:ASTFORUM), America Online (KEYWORD:AST) and Prodigy (JUMP:AST
			SUPPORT) on-line forums also allow users to talk, meet, share ideas and answer questions with other AST users</TD>
