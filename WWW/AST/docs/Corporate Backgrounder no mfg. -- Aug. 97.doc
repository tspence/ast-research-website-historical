\par }\pard \fi720\sl360\slmult1\widctlpar\adjustright {AST is one of the pioneering companies of the PC industry, starting from an Orange County garage and rapidly becoming one of the most successful firms in U.S. business history.  The company was established in 1980 by }{\b\ul A}{lbert Wong, }{\b\ul S}{afi Qureshey, and }{\b\ul T}{om Yuen who agreed that they could produce enhancement boards for the original IBM PCs that would improve system speed and flexibility.  The fledgling company quickly achieved considerable success for its products and soon expanded to become a prominent international manufacturer.
\par }\pard \sl360\slmult1\widctlpar\adjustright {\tab In 1986, AST introduced its first PC and quickly made a name for itself as a world-class innovator by having the world\rquote s first upgradeable PC.  The company had already established itself as a leader in product quality, innovative technology, manufacturing expertise, and superior service, so its PCs were quickly embraced by the industry.  Sales grew until AST was one of the top PC manufacturers in the world during the late 80s and early 90s.  Since then, AST has undertaken comprehensive reorganization efforts and was acquired by Samsung in August 1997.
\par }\pard \fi720\sl360\slmult1\widctlpar\adjustright {AST currently has 3,000 employees and operates in more than 100 countries worldwide.  The company sold more than one million PCs in 1996.

\par }{\tab \ldblquote AST forms the linchpin in Samsung\rquote s plan for defining, developing and producing the new technologies of the 21}{\super st}{ century,\rdblquote  said S.T. Kim, AST president and chief executive officer and head of Samsung\rquote s global PC operations.  \ldblquote As a world leader in semiconductors, displays and other computer technologies, Samsung will use AST as the front runner for linking the various Samsung Electronics divisions together to leverage Samsung\rquote s diversity and vision of being a total solutions provider.
\par \tab As a total solutions provider, Samsung will integrate products and services from the company\rquote s numerous technology divisions \endash  which include computers, semiconductors, consumer electronics, communications equipment and software -- to deliver new and unique offerings for business and home users worldwide.
\par }\pard \fi720\sl360\slmult1\widctlpar\adjustright {\page \ldblquote We will witness a change in both our business and personal lifestyles as the digital revolution takes hold.  We believe that together, AST and Samsung are poised for tremendous growth in these areas,\rdblquote  said Kim.

\par \tab }{The company\rquote s mission}{\b  }{is twofold: to be the most responsive company in the PC industry by enabling customers to achieve their goals and to surpass customer expectations for technology, timeliness, quality and service.
\par \tab AST\rquote s long-term goals include becoming the industry\rquote s leading information technology provider and being one of the world\rquote s top five PC suppliers by 2005.  To accomplish this, the company\rquote s short and medium-term activities involve aggressive product development and marketing targeted to both large corporations and small to medium-sized businesses.  
\par }\pard \fi720\sl360\slmult1\widctlpar\adjustright {\ldblquote We have created a new AST,\rdblquote  said Kim.  \ldblquote Stability, a return to profitability and being the industry\rquote s most responsive company are the goals for the remainder of this year and throughout 1998.  Once this is achieved, we will focus on growth by continuing to deliver better value to customers than our competitors.
\par \ldblquote In addition, to satisfy volatile customer needs in a timely manner, we are reducing our order-to-delivery cycles as a result of more efficient manufacturing operations.  By the year 2000, we plan to proliferate our server business in the multimedia network environment and expand our business in the consumer sector with convergence products such as PC Theater.  From these efforts, we expect to regain market share and expand within a new emerging market as an industry leader.\rdblquote 
\par AST\rquote s aggressive product development efforts will be supported by significantly increasing the company\rquote s R&D investments.  Plans call for doubling the R&D budget by 1999 and quadrupling spending by 2001.
\par In focusing on the commercial segment, AST will differentiate its business desktop systems to meet specific geographical and functional needs.  Future desktop designs will employ a modular design to support the company\rquote s new build-to-order strategy.
\par For notebooks, AST will utilize Samsung\rquote s vast resources in flat-panel displays, hard disk drives, memory and other components to produce high-end and mid-range systems with the latest and most popular features.
\par \page For servers, AST has significantly increased its activities to focus on application servers for the Internet and networked PCs.  The company will soon expand its server development team in order to enhance its development efforts and broaden the scope of the company\rquote s product offerings.
\par Each of these products is backed by industry-leading service and support plans that are among the industry\rquote s most responsive.
