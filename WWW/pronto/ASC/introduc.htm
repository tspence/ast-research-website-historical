<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">AST Research, Inc. announces the latest 1997 edition of the <b>Authorized
  Service Center Handbook - <i>How the Americas Do Business with AST. </b></i>This handbook
  provides you with reference material that encompasses the most current service policies,
  procedures, programs, and product information of AST Research, Inc.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">The ASC Handbook has been designed to provide you with a comprehensive,
  yet concise source on how to do business with AST Service. Our goal is to ensure that your
  experiences with AST Service are always handled professionally and in a timely manner.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">The format gives us the flexibility to easily update sections as
  required, and every effort has been made to organize the information in such a way that
  all related materials appear in common sections for ease of use.</font></p>
  </a><p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Important Announcement</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Effective immediately, AST has made the following changes to the names
  of our different service authorization levels. Previously, &quot;ASC&quot; referred to
  Authorized Service Center - locations who had met the requirements to be authorized by AST
  for depot only service. The new &quot;ASC Gold&quot; Program was established in December
  of 1996 to offer an intermediate service solution for top ASC&#146;s that also needed
  on-site authorization. The &quot;ASSC&quot; Program indicated our highest level of
  authorization and service expertise. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">In an effort to standardize not only our nomenclature, but our service
  offerings as well, service locations for the United States will now be recognized by the
  following designations:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">All service locations are <b>A</b>uthorized <b>S</b>ervice <b>C</b>enters
  (ASCs). </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>Previous Program New Program Name</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><i>ASC</i> <b>ASC <i>Gold</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font size="2"><i>ASC Gold</i> <b>ASC <i>Platinum</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font size="2"><i>ASSC</i> <b>ASC<i> Diamond</font></b></i></p>
  <p><font size="2">The requirements and terms and conditions have <b><i>not</i></b>
  changed. If you have questions regarding your authorization status, please contact the AST
  Field Service Administrator at 817-230-5800, ext. 3805.</font></p>
