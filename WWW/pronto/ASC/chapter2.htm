<p><font size="4"><b>AST Return Policy</b></font></p>

<p><b>DOA Policy valid for Direct Resellers in the USA only</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Only accounts that have a direct sales relationship with AST may return
  product directly to AST. These resellers may return defective product they have received
  to AST for credit.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="1"><b>Please see your current program booklet for current policies on Stock
  Rotation, DOA Returns and Customer Satisfaction issues.</b></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Issuing of DOA RA</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Direct Resellers must call their Inside Sales Associate to receive an
  RA#. A serial number, part number, and reason for product failure (if known) should be
  provided. Inside Sales Associates are grouped by territory:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">NCA Headquarters (800) 244-1460</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Northwest (800) 263-8014</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">North Central (800) 263-8019</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Northeast (800) 945-2278</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Southwest (800) 723-2278</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">South Central (800) 263-8018</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Southeast (800) 263-8015</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- When the requirements are met, the AST Inside Sales Associate will
    issue a DOA credit RA package.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- AST will pay for freight costs. Mode of in-bound transportation will
    be determined by the AST Inside Sales Associate.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Requirements of Reseller</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- Attach all relevant RA documentation and labels to the product.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- Remove all non-AST Components (e.g., co-processor chips) from the AST
    product being returned.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The AST Authorized Systems Reseller may not take DOA credit deductions
  on future remittances until AST has issued a credit memo and after the AST Quality
  Assurance Group inspection. <i>Invalid DOA credit deduction on remittances will result in
  possible customer credit hold until the invalid deduction has been repaid.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Return of Product</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">As with all AST RAs, product must be received within 30 days of issuance
  or the RA will be closed and no longer valid. If the product is received after the
  expiration date, the AST Authorized Systems Reseller will have the option of:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- Being directed to AST&#146;s Service and Support Organization to
    request a regular repair RA as the product will now fall under AST&#146;s normal Warranty
    Program, or;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- Having the product returned to the AST Authorized Systems
    Reseller&#146;s location. If the product is returned to the Reseller, the Reseller will be
    billed for the return freight costs.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">If the product is received before the RA expiration date, AST will
  receive, test, and inspect the product. There are two possible types of credit which may
  be issued:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- If the product is returned under a valid DOA RA, the product will be
    considered to be DOA with a credit memo issued for the original purchase price less any
    subsequent adjustments. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- The Reseller will be billed for any missing AST components of a
    systems product which is found to be DOA. (The cost of a component is AST&#146;s current
    price.)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Credit Memos</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- The amount of credit issued will be based upon the current price of
    the product at the time the RA was issued.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- No adjustments for Net 1 Payments will be made by AST.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- Missing component charges (if applicable) will be clearly identified
    on the credit memo.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- AST will issue credit memos within 15 days after receipt of valid DOA
    product.</font></p>
