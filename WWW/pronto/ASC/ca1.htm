<H2>1.1 Introduction</A></H2>
<BR>
AST wishes to assure customers of the highest possible
quality product - an extension of this is to have only qualified
technical staff carrying out warranty repairs and modifications.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Every ASC central location will have a minimum
of two AST certified technicians on duty, and every remote location
will have a minimum of one certified technician available - in
both cases the technicians will have to meet the service response
/delivery parameters agreed to within the ASC Agreement.<BR>
</B>
<P>
There are two levels of training certification. 
AST recognized A+ Certification as the pre-requisite to becoming
service authorized.  Following A+ certification, in order to maintain
AST Service Authorization, AST specific classroom training is
required..  From time to time AST will make available, at a cost,
Computer Based Training modules, which will enable Authorized
Service Centres to train on new products prior to classroom training.

<HR><H2><A NAME="toc15">1.5 Certification Process</A></H2>
<BR>
ASC's are certified on a specific product list based
on their Reseller Agreements with AST and the technician's certification.
 Copies of all A+ certificates must be sent to AST Service to
be included in our files.<BR>

<HR><H2><A NAME="toc16">1.6 Referral Centres</A></H2>
<BR>
In order to be on the AST Referral list, ASCs must
be willing to service any customer who comes as a referral, have
training on all AST product and perform both on-site and depot
warranty service.  ASCs meeting these criteria are welcome to
request placement on the AST ASC referral list.
