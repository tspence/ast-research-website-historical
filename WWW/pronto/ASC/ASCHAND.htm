 $ # Return Authorization / Parts Exchange Program

This section describes the procedures to follow when returning components to AST for repair or replacement.  The primary function of the Product Returns Department is to issue Return Authorization numbers (RANs) to resellers and distributors for the repair of AST Products.
The following procedure is used to obtain a RA for returning a defective or failed AST component for repair:

1.	If you have utilized the ASC Technical Support Line to assist in diagnosing a defective/failed AST component, then he/she will issue a RA for the component in need of repair.
	For AST Authorized Service Centers outside of the United States, please FAX in the RAN request to (817) 230-5910 using the Cross-Ship and Product Repair Form.  This form will be FAXed back to the ASC with the appropriate RAN listed in the right-hand column.  This number must be referenced on all correspondence and during all phone conversations.
	If you have diagnosed the defective/failed AST component on your own, you will need to call the AST Repair RA Department, using the ASC Support Line at (800) 288-4278, Option # 2.  You must identify yourself as an AST Authorized Service Center by providing your ASC Number.  You will be asked to provide the model number, serial number, and quantity for the component you are returning for repair.  The Service Representative will also need your name, your company name, ship-to-address, and the telephone number.  Also state if the component is in- or out-of-warranty.
Important note: BROKEN DISPLAYS
Fractures or cracks on LCD's are not covered under warranty. Any cracked displays that are received by AST will be billed back to the Service Center responsible for placing the in-warranty exchange order.  Please notify your customers immediately upon receipt of the damaged notebook that they are responsible for the labor, transportation and parts corresponding to any repair that fits the criteria as listed below from their warranty statement.
Look for indications of cracks or dents on the outside case or corners, which are signals that the unit has been dropped or shipped without proper packaging. Indentations or scratches on the membrane of the LCD may also  indicate rough or abusive handling.
	If a unit or screen assembly arrives at AST damaged, it is the responsibility of the Service Center to file a claim with their carrier to compensate for any charges
A.	Exchange Procedures are available in cases where your spare parts inventory is depleted.  AST offers emergency cross-shipment of parts to perform the repair for in-warranty and out-of-warranty parts. To be eligible for a cross-shipment, an ASC must be authorized by AST to repair the specific product in question.
B.	If the component is covered under AST warranty, there is no charge for parts and labor involved in the repair.  The CPU serial number will be used to verify the warranty of the unit.  On certain occasions, the CPU serial number will be out of warranty or will not appear in our database.  When this occurs, your AST representative will ask for warranty verification.  The following forms of warranty verification, including the CPU serial number, will be accepted:
-	Copy of the original Bill of Sale.
-	Copy of the original invoice, with payment indicated.
-	Copy of the canceled check, with reference to what was purchased.
-	Copy of the credit card receipt, with reference to what was purchased.
	When proof of purchase is received, the data will be entered into the AST database in order to prevent any delays in future part orders.
C.	If you have a net terms account with AST, a purchase order will be accepted on any transaction per your request.  If you do not have a net terms account with AST, you may be required to guarantee payment by credit card and your credit card number will be required for each transaction.  You may elect to participate in the Blanket Purchase Order Program for In-Warranty exchanges only.  Each exchange part must be returned to  AST within 20 days of its ship date.  If the part is still outstanding on the 21st day, AST will debit your warranty reimbursements or bill your credit card for the full ASC price, plus a $25.00 cross-ship fee. If you are ordering in-warranty exchange parts with a Blanket Purchase Order and fail to return a part, the cost of that part plus the $25.00 fee will be deducted from your warranty reimbursements.
	Please be sure to follow the requirements below to ensure the prompt handling of your order:
1.	RA should be prominently displayed.
2.	Return the same part number that was received.
3.	All parts and chips must be the same as originally sent, i.e. CPU and memory.
	If your part is received in a discrepant manner, it will be returned with a traveler indicating why the part is being denied.  If the part is sent correctly within 20 days from the original ship date, your account will not be billed, nor will your warranty payments be debited.
	AST does not require proof of purchase when sending the COMPTIA (ABCD) form, although we may request it if the warranty of the computer cannot be verified.
D.	If the component is not covered under the warranty, then you may be instructed to FAX the Purchase Order (PO) to 817-230-5929.  If you do not have a  30-day account with AST, you may pay for the repair with a credit card, or check. If this repair is exempt for sales-tax charges, please provide your Sales Tax Number.
	For AST Authorized Service Centers outside of the United States, if the component is not covered under warranty, you may pay for the repair with a credit card.  After receiving your FAX, the CSR will figure the repair charges, call you with the total, and collect credit card payment at that time.  If you need to contact the CSR for any questions, please call 1-817-230-5800, Ext. 863 or Ext. 800.
	The exchange process is available for out-of-warranty product for the cost of the component repair and an additional fee to cover cross-ship costs.  This cross-ship fee is $25.00 for each part.  Shipping charges are applicable.  After AST receives the out-of-warranty payment plus the additional fee for the cross-ship, AST will ship the replacement part.  (This fee is effective February 1, 1995.)
	If the out-of-warranty part is returned unused, there will be a restocking fee of 20% of list price.  Cross-ship fee is non-refundable.
	AST Authorized Service Centers will not be paid for warranty work done on a cross-ship/exchange until the defective part is returned to AST Research, Inc., 1001 N.E. Loop 820, Dock # 5, Fort Worth, TX 76131.  AST will pay for shipping charges (one way) to the Service Center on cross-ship/exchange parts.  The Service Center is responsible for the cost and all liability of returning a part to AST. If parts have not been returned after a period of thirty (30) days, then the ASC can lose the privilege to cross-ship/exchange repair parts. If parts have not been returned after a period of sixty (60) days, then the ASC's account can be placed on hold.

2.	To protect your customers' investment in AST system enhancements, be sure to remove all options (e.g.: math co-processors) and non-AST components before sending products in for repair, unless the option is related to the problem.  Such options may be lost or damaged during the repair process.  There is no guarantee that these items will be returned, unless the option is related to the repair.  AST accepts no responsibility for customer-owned AST and/or non-AST options.

3.	Describe the problem in writing and return any accessories only if they are related to the problem.  For example, if the parallel port does not function correctly, be sure to return the parallel port adapter cable with the board.

4.	Reference the RA issued to on all correspondence.  Securely package all material to prevent shipping damage. The RAN must appear on the outside of the shipping carton.  Shipping charges must be prepaid; COD's will not be accepted.
AST Computer
1001 N.E. Loop 820
Dock # 5, RA # ________
Fort Worth, TX 76131

All components being sent in for repair must be assigned an RA.  If the component arrives without an RA printed on the outside of the package, it will be refused and returned to sender.  RA's issued are only valid for sixty (60) days.  Any RA in the AST database which has nothing received against it within sixty (60) days will be closed.

If you wish to check on the status of your returned component, you will need to call the AST RA/Status Team, by using the ASC Support Line at (800) 288-4278, Option # 3,1.  Turnaround times on repairs will vary.  This time will be quoted at the time the RA is issued.

The hours of operation for the Product Returns Department are Monday-Friday, 8AM-7PM, Central Standard Time (CST).

 $ # On-Site Service Program

Every AST computer system is now covered by one of the most comprehensive warranty programs in existence today.  All Desktops and Servers with AST factory installed hard drives will be covered by an On-Site Service Program.  Below is a listing of the warranty coverage on AST Desktops and Servers.
 *	On-Site Service applies to products sold and serviced in the United States only.
 *	Only Advanced Support Systems Centers (ASSC's) are authorized by AST to provide on-site service. 
The AST Premium (SE), Premmia SE & MTE Servers, and Manhattan P,V,G, and SMP families are typically used to handle mission critical applications for a company or a department within a company.  Therefore, these systems now carry a full 3-year On-Site Warranty.
AST Premmia, Bravo and Power Premium systems are our highly integrated yet expandable desktop solutions designed to run today's most demanding business applications.  These systems have a warranty program that combines the convenience of on-site service during the first year of ownership and an additional two years of carry-in service for a total of three years coverage.  If your customers prefer the convenience of on-site service, On-Site Service Program Upgrades can be purchased for up to three years of coverage from date of product purchase.
As an AST ASC or ASSC, offering your customers the AST On-Site Service Program Upgrades have the following major benefits:
-	A 3-year warranty commits the end user to you for three years of service.
-	ASCs and ASSCs will receive a discount equal to 15% of the AST On-Site warranty upgrade (applies to Premmia, Bravo, and Power Premium families only) selling price for every On-Site upgrade sold.  Be sure to record your name and service center number on the registration card.
-	You can purchase the AST On-Site warranty upgrades and use them to underwrite your own service agreements.  The AST On-Site service upgrades  can be incorporated as part of an on-site maintenance agreement you currently sell to your customers. 

Policies
The AST On-Site Service Program covers product failures that occur during normal use of the product by the end user.  These failures are corrected by the  ASSC at no charge to the end user.  The ASSC making the repairs is reimbursed by AST for parts and labor required to repair covered failures under the terms and conditions of the AST Authorized Service Center program (Warranty Reimbursement Procedure). An ASSC is also reimbursed for travel if dispatched on-site by AST.  Failures resulting from accident, abuse, misuse, modifications or unauthorized repairs are excluded from coverage.
The AST On-Site Service warranty upgrades can be purchased by contacting the AST Warranty Registration Department at (800) 727-1278 (Option #3). Your 15% discount will be based on the selling price of the upgrade. The AST On-Site Upgrade form is part of the product registration form and is included in all system boxes.  The On-Site Service Program is not transferable.
AST systems with AST factory installed hard drives are covered under the On-Site Service program.  On an exception-only basis, with prior approval from a Field Engineer,  an ASSC may buy a base model (3V) and install an AST hard drive, then the system will carry the On-Site Service. The ASSC will be responsible for registering the system for the customer with the AST Warranty Registration Department.  If the system is configured with a third party hard drive, the system will be covered but the hard drive (or any third party components) will not..
There are no provisions to warrant software under the On-Site Service program.
AST  floppy drives, memory, etc. will be covered under the On-Site service program if the upgrades were installed by AST or an ASSC.  These upgrades will carry the same warranty as the system unit for the remainder of that system unit warranty, or 1 year of carry-in warranty, whichever is greater.  Keyboards, monitors, external speakers and pointing devices will be exchanged directly with the end user. AST will not pay On-Site reimbursements for these items.
Procedure for Providing Service under the AST On-Site Service Program
If you are an AST Advanced Systems Support Center (ASSC) you are eligible to provide on-site warranty repair service on these products at the request of AST or your customers.  The program also provides you with the opportunity to supplement your service revenue by offering your customers service upgrade options including on-site maintenance outside of the 100-mile radius of an AST Authorized On-Site Service location and extended hours coverage.  Next business day, same-day fix with 2 or 4-hour response time, and additional years of on-site coverage are other options you can make available to your customers for an additional fee.
By following the ASSC on-site provider program instructions as detailed in these procedures, you will receive an on-site visit reimbursement fee.
Customers in need of on-site warranty service may contact an ASSC or AST Technical Support directly at (800) 727-1278.

If a customer contacts you, please follow the guidelines detailed below:
-	As the first level of support, ASSC will screen the call to determine whether the problem is related to application software or a hardware malfunction.
-	If problem is non-hardware related, ASSC will resolve problem and close call.
-	If problem is believed to be hardware related, ASSC will contact AST ASSC support group (1-800-288-4278) and notify an AST Technician of need to perform an on-site call and request a replacement FRU, if needed.  ASSC must speak to an AST Technician and receive an on-site call authorization number or the ASSC may call or fax a request to open a work order with the ASSC support administrator. This fax number is (817) 230-5925. AST reserves the right to contact end user for verification of on-site request.
-	ASSC will contact AST upon completion of call to close call.  AST may contact the contact end user to verify on-site call was performed and to survey end user's satisfaction with the service experience.
-	ASSC will submit warranty reimbursement claim for labor and on-site reimbursement.

If the customer contacts AST for service, the following steps will take place:
-	As the first level of support, AST will screen the call to determine whether the problem is related to application software or a hardware malfunction.
-	If problem is non-hardware related, AST will resolve problem and close call.
-	If problem is believed to be hardware related, the on-site provider on record for this customer will be contacted and requested to accept the on-site dispatch.  If you accept the dispatch request, you will be given an on-site call authorization number and the replacement FRU as specified by AST Technical Support will be cross-shipped to you.
-	Upon receiving the part needed for repair, you will promptly contact customer and arrange to repair customer's system at customer location.
-	ASSC will contact AST upon completion of call to close call.  AST will contact end user to verify on-site call was performed and to survey end user's satisfaction with service experience.
-	ASSC will submit warranty reimbursement claim for labor and on-site reimbursement.

The AST On-Site Service Program is committed to total customer satisfaction and an attempt will be made to survey every customer to measure his/her satisfaction with the service experience.  Any service center that does not maintain the standards of excellence as defined by AST will not be allowed to continue in the on-site program.

This fee does not apply to any software problem. As software is not covered under the manufacturer's warranty, it  is the responsibility of the Service Center to collect from the customer payment as necessary for software diagnosis and service (including virus elimination). 
	If a customer is referred to any ASC/ASSC by AST, resulting in diagnostic work performed by the service center, then AST will apply the $35.00 labor only fee as compensation for diagnostic time spent. Reimbursements for diagnostics are approved on a case- by- case basis.

	AST will at no time reimburse the $35.00 rate in addition to the per incident rate on any repair. 
	Reimbursements are paid per incident, regardless of the number of FRU's needed per repair. Claims filed against the same serialized unit within 30 days of the original claim filed will be returned to the service center, unpaid.
	All pricing is subject to change without notice.


 $ # Service Training	Print Video Order Form%!PopupID(`aschand.mvb', `ctx_forms_videokit>forms')

The Role of Service Training
AST's Service Training's role is to train and certify technicians to perform warranty repairs on AST computer systems. Our primary audience for this type of training is microcomputer support personnel and field service technicians.  Having a certified technician is one of the requirements for a reseller who wants to participate in the AST Authorized Service Center Program. 
Currently AST requires the completion of A Certification as the foundation of training authorization. A certification is a nationally recognized, industry-wide standard that certifies the competency of individuals in the microcomputer industry. These exams are open to anyone who wishes to take them and are given at Drake/Sylvan Prometric Authorized Testing Centers all over the country. For more information regarding the exams, dates and locations you may call 1-800-77MICRO.

Technical courses on all product lines are offered at AST Computer in Fort Worth, Texas. A course catalog and class schedule is available on AST's Info-FAX at 1-800-926-1278 (request Catalog #9). In addition, videotape-based courses, CBT's and other supplemental product material  offer the flexibility and convenience of a self-paced training package that can enhance the technicians' AST product knowledge.
The Objectives
The training objectives are linked with AST's service philosophy that each computer product is to be repaired to the major component level.  At the completion of each self-study course, the student should understand the product and what goes into it, be comfortable with disassembly and reassembly of the system, and know how to troubleshoot the system to the major component level.  
Video Training
Ordering information is available from PC Service Source (1-800-464-2781) or call AST's InfoFAX at 1-800-926-1278 (request Catalog #9). These videos are for informational purposes only. Please DO NOT return video training tests.

AST Authorized Resellers and Authorized Service Centers may purchase training kits at a discount.

Video Format
All video training kits are offered in two video formats.  The NTSC format is used in the U.S.A. and Canada.  International video equipment will generally require the PAL format.
