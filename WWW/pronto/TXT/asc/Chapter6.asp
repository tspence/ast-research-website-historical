<p><b>The Role of Service Training</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">AST&#146;s Service Training&#146;s role is
    to train and certify technicians to perform warranty repairs
    on AST computer systems. Our primary audience for this type
    of training is microcomputer support personnel and field
    service technicians. Having a certified technician is one of
    the requirements for a reseller who wants to participate in
    the AST Authorized Service Center Program. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Currently AST requires the completion of A
    Certification as the foundation of training authorization. A
    certification is a nationally recognized, industry-wide
    standard that certifies the competency of individuals in the
    microcomputer industry. These exams are open to anyone who
    wishes to take them and are given at Drake/Sylvan Prometric
    Authorized Testing Centers all over the country. For more
    information regarding the exams, dates and locations you may
    call 1-800-77MICRO.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Technical courses on all product lines are
    offered at AST Computer in Fort Worth, Texas. A course
    catalog and class schedule is available on AST&#146;s
    Info-FAX at 1-800-926-1278 (request Catalog #9). In addition,
    videotape-based courses, CBT&#146;s and other supplemental
    product material offer the flexibility and convenience of a
    self-paced training package that can enhance the
    technicians&#146; AST product knowledge.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>The Objectives</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The training objectives are linked with
    AST's service philosophy that each computer product is to be
    repaired to the major component level. At the completion of
    each self-study course, the student should understand the
    product and what goes into it, be comfortable with
    disassembly and reassembly of the system, and know how to
    troubleshoot the system to the major component level. </font></p>
