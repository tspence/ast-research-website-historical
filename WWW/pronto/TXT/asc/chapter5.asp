<p><font size="4"><b>On-Site Service Program</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Many AST computer systems are now covered
    by one of the most comprehensive warranty programs in
    existence today.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="1"><b>* On-Site Service applies to
        products sold and serviced in the United States only.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="1"><b>* AST must pre-authorize any service
        center to provide on-site service for that location to be
        eligible for reimbursement. </b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The <b>AST Premium (SE), Premmia SE &amp;
    MTE Servers, and Manhattan P,V,G, and SMP families</b> are
    typically used to handle mission critical applications for a
    company or a department within a company. Therefore, these
    systems carry a full <b>3-year On-Site Warranty</b>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>AST Premmia, and Bravo MS </b>are our
    highly integrated yet expandable desktop solutions designed
    to run today's most demanding business applications. These
    systems have a warranty program that <b>combines the
    convenience of on-site service during the first year of
    ownership and an additional two years of carry-in service for
    a total of three years coverage. </b>If your customers prefer
    the convenience of on-site service, On-Site Service Program
    Upgrades can be purchased for up to three years of coverage
    from date of product purchase.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As an AST service center offering your
    customers the AST On-Site Service Program Upgrades have the
    following major benefits:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">- A 3-year warranty commits the end
        user to you for three years of service.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- All Resellers will receive a discount
        equal to 15% of the AST On-Site warranty upgrade (applies
        to Premmia, Bravo families only) selling price for every
        On-Site upgrade sold. Be sure to record your name and
        service center number on the registration card.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- You can purchase the AST On-Site
        warranty upgrades and use them to underwrite your own
        service agreements. The AST On-Site service upgrades can
        be incorporated as part of an on-site maintenance
        agreement you currently sell to your customers. </font></p>
    </blockquote>

<p><b>Policies</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The AST On-Site Service Program covers
    product failures that occur during normal use of the product
    by the end user. These failures are corrected by the On-Site
    authorized service location at no charge to the end user. The
    On-Site Provider making the repairs is reimbursed by AST for
    parts and labor required to repair covered failures under the
    terms and conditions of the AST Authorized Service Center
    program (Warranty Reimbursement Procedure). Failures
    resulting from accident, abuse, misuse, modifications or
    unauthorized repairs are excluded from coverage.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The AST On-Site Service warranty upgrades
    can be purchased by contacting the AST Warranty Registration
    Department at (800) 727-1278 (Option #3). Your 15% discount
    will be based on the selling price of the upgrade. <b>The AST
    On-Site Upgrade form is part of the product registration form
    and is included in all system boxes. The On-Site Service
    Program is not transferable.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>AST systems with AST factory installed
    hard drives are covered under the On-Site Service program. On
    an exception-only basis, with prior approval from AST Service
    a Reseller may buy a base model (3V) and install an AST hard
    drive, then the system will carry the On-Site Service. The
    Reseller will be responsible for registering the system for
    the customer with the AST Warranty Registration Department.
    If the system is configured with a third party hard drive,
    the system will be covered but the hard drive (or any third
    party components) will not..</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>There are no provisions to warrant
    software under the On-Site Service program.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">AST floppy drives, memory, etc. will be
    covered under the On-Site service program if the upgrades
    were installed by AST or an Reseller. These upgrades will
    carry the same warranty as the system unit for the remainder
    of that system unit warranty, or 1 year of carry-in warranty,
    whichever is greater. <b>Keyboards, monitors, external
    speakers and pointing devices will be exchanged directly with
    the end user. </b>AST will not pay On-Site reimbursements for
    these items.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Procedure for Providing Service under the AST On-Site
Service Program</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">By following the on-site provider program
    instructions as detailed in these procedures, you will
    receive an on-site visit reimbursement fee.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Customers in need of on-site warranty
    service may contact an AST Authorized On-Site Provider or AST
    Technical Support directly at (800) 727-1278.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If a customer contacts you, please follow
    the guidelines detailed below:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">- As the first level of support, the
        authorized provider will screen the call to determine
        whether the problem is related to application software or
        a hardware malfunction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- If problem is non-hardware related,
        the provider will resolve problem and close call.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- If problem is believed to be hardware
        related, the on-site provider will contact the AST ASC
        support group (1-800-288-4278) and notify AST of the
        request to perform an on-site call and order a
        replacement FRU, if needed. The AST authorized provider
        must receive an on-site call authorization number via
        telephone call with a support technician or by faxing a
        request to open a work order with the ASC support
        administrator. This fax number is (817) 230-5925. AST
        reserves the right to contact end user for verification
        of on-site request.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- The authorized provider will contact
        AST upon completion of call to close call. AST may
        contact the contact end user to verify on-site call was
        performed and to survey end user&#146;s satisfaction with
        the service experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- The authorized provider may then
        submit a warranty reimbursement claim for labor and
        on-site reimbursement.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">If the customer contacts AST for service,
    the following steps will take place:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">- As the first level of support, AST
        will screen the call to determine whether the problem is
        related to application software or a hardware
        malfunction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- If problem is non-hardware related,
        AST will resolve problem and close call.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- If problem is believed to be hardware
        related and there is an on-site provider on record for
        this customer, the on-site provider will be contacted and
        requested to accept the on-site dispatch. If you accept
        the dispatch request, you will be given an on-site call
        authorization number and the replacement FRU as specified
        by AST Technical Support will be cross-shipped to you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- Upon receiving the part needed for
        repair, you will promptly contact customer and arrange to
        repair customer&#146;s system at customer location.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- The on-site provider will contact AST
        upon completion of call to close call. AST will contact
        end user to verify on-site call was performed and to
        survey end user&#146;s satisfaction with service
        experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">- The authorized provider may then
        submit a warranty reimbursement claim for labor and
        on-site reimbursement.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The AST On-Site Service Program is
    committed to total customer satisfaction and an attempt will
    be made to survey every customer to measure his/her
    satisfaction with the service experience. Any service center
    that does not maintain the standards of excellence as defined
    by AST will not be allowed to continue in the on-site
    program.</font></p>
