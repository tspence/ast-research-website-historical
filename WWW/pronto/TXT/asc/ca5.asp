<H1>5 Warranty Programs</A></H1>
<hr><H2>5.1 AST Warranty</A><BR></H2>
AST provides a one or three year warranty, part of
which may be on-site with the remainder to depot, depending on
the product purchased by the user.<BR>

<P>
AST wishes to protect the user from any failures
that may result from a defect in materials or workmanship. The
user's warranty commences on the purchase date from the dealer.
 Copies of the warranty are included with the product.<BR>

<P>
Warranty does NOT cover problems resulting from misuse,
abuse, accident ( e.g. liquid into the monitor or keyboard) ,
lightning, modifications, or service by anyone other than an authorized
AST service provider.<BR>

<P>
AST Canada will, at its option, repair or replace
any defective involved product(s), or the entire unit.  <BR>

<P>
<B>AST's obligation is to return the unit to functionality
where it will pass AST hardware diagnostics. For Advantage products
 any replacement hard drives should be formatted so the user can
reload the restore CD provided with their system. The user is
then responsible for restoration of software and data .<BR>
</B>
<P>
AST ASCs will be reimbursed for each valid warranty
repair event, including travel when on-site is part of the warranty.
 (See section 5.3 &amp; 5.4 )<BR>

<P>
The AST warranty is issued to the original purchaser
and is not transferable.<BR>

<P>
Warranties are country specific i.e. product purchased
in Canada receives warranty service within Canada, unless the
product's warranty is &quot;world-wide&quot;.<BR>

<P>
<B>Limited Warranty on Options<BR>
</B>
<P>
The warranty on AST options is the same as the product
 in which they are installed.  The specific warranty is included
with the products, and within the Resellers Agreement - which

<hr><H2><A NAME="56">5.6 Labour Reimbursement</A></H2>
<br>
AST will reimburse ASCs for labour used to repair
 products in warranty - provided  no abuse, neglect, damage, etc.
is involved.  Labour rates are attached to the Authorized Service
Centre Agreement and are dependant on the authorization level;
Gold, Platinum or Diamond.<BR>

<P>
Warranty labour reimbursement is based on one work
sequence to fix the problem - regardless of the number of parts
required.  Similarly, only one site visit is covered.<BR>

<P>
The ASC has the responsibility to assure that the
product is operating properly prior to completing the work.  Your
ASC Agreement explains your workmanship warranty.<BR>

<P>
The industry standard CTIA form is used to claim
warranty parts and labor.  Complete the form to the extent shown
in Attachment 3. Transaction Codes are C for Carry In Service
and O for On Site.  AST will pay reimbursement up to 30 days from
the time of repair.  Any forms submitted after 30 days will not
be honoured.<BR>

<P>
The form is to be forwarded with the returning part
- within 15 days of AST shipping you the part required.  A POP
should be enclosed if requested on your return copy of the RAN.
<BR>

<P>
The use of this standard form eliminates the need
for multiple forms and tags.  When completed and returned with
the returning part(s), your paperwork with AST will be complete.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Adjustment Reimbursement</B>
<P>
Service actions which do not require the replacement
of parts ( e.g. Monitor adjustment, Software related customer
satisfaction issues ) require AST Canada's prior authorization
if the ASC is to be reimbursed.<BR>

<P>
Submit a completed CTIA form COMPLETE WITH THE AST
AUTHORIZATION NUMBER describing the symptoms and your actions.
 A &quot;Labour Only&quot; fee will be reimbursed.<BR>
