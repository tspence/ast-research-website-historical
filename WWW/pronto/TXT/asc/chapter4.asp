Program</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">This section describes the procedures to
    follow when returning components to AST for repair or
    replacement. The primary function of the Product Returns
    Department is to issue Return Authorization numbers (RAs) to
    resellers and distributors for the repair of AST Products.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As a complement to our standard parts
    exchange program, AST offers an on-line parts ordering and
    claims processing program, utilizing the real-time
    capabilities of the Internet. Information on this new
    service, 
	
	<A NAME="ast"></A>
	
	AST <i>Now!</i></font><font size="2">follows this section.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following procedure is used to obtain
    an RA for returning a defective or failed AST component for
    repair:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>1.</b> If you have utilized the ASC
        Technical Support Line to assist in diagnosing a
        defective/failed AST component, then he/she will issue a
        RA for the component in need of repair.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>For AST Authorized Service Centers
        outside of the United States, please FAX in the RA
        request to (817) 230-5910 using the Cross-Ship and
        Product Repair Form. This form will be FAXed back to the
        ASC with the appropriate RA listed in the right-hand
        column. This number must be referenced on all
        correspondence and during all phone conversations.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If you have diagnosed the
        defective/failed AST component on your own, you will need
        to call the AST Repair RA Department, using the ASC
        Support Line at (800) 288-4278, Option # 2. You must <u>identify
        yourself</u> as an AST Authorized Service Center by
        providing your <u>ASC Number</u>. You will be asked to
        provide the model number, serial number, and quantity for
        the component you are returning for repair. The Service
        Representative will also need your name, your company
        name, ship-to-address, and the telephone number. Also
        state if the component is in- or out-of-warranty.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Important note: <b>BROKEN DISPLAYS</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Fractures or cracks on LCD&#146;s
        are not covered under warranty</b>. Any cracked displays
        that are received by AST will be billed back to the
        Service Center responsible for placing the in-warranty
        exchange order. Please notify your customers immediately
        upon receipt of the damaged notebook that they are
        responsible for the labor, transportation and parts
        corresponding to any repair that fits the criteria as
        listed below from their warranty statement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Look for indications of cracks or dents
        on the outside case or corners, which are signals that
        the unit has been dropped or shipped without proper
        packaging. Indentations or scratches on the membrane of
        the LCD may also indicate rough or abusive handling.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If a unit or screen assembly arrives at
        AST damaged, it is the responsibility of the Service
        Center to file a claim with their carrier to compensate
        for any charges</font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2"><b>A.</b> Exchange Procedures are
            available in cases where your spare parts inventory
            is depleted. AST offers emergency cross-shipment of
            parts to perform the repair for in-warranty and
            out-of-warranty parts. To be eligible for a
            cross-shipment, an ASC must be authorized by AST to
            repair the specific product in question.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>B.</b> If the component is
            covered under AST warranty, there is no charge for
            parts and labor involved in the repair. The CPU
            serial number will be used to verify the warranty of
            the unit. On certain occasions, the CPU serial number
            will be out of warranty or will not appear in our
            database. When this occurs, your AST representative
            will ask for warranty verification. The following
            forms of warranty verification, including the CPU
            serial number, will be accepted:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="2">- Copy of the original Bill of
                Sale.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">- Copy of the original invoice,
                with payment indicated.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">- Copy of the canceled check,
                with reference to what was purchased.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">- Copy of the credit card
                receipt, with reference to what was purchased.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font size="2">When proof of purchase is received,
            the data will be entered into the AST database in
            order to prevent any delays in future part orders.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>C.</b> If you have a net terms
            account with AST, a purchase order will be accepted
            on any transaction per your request. <b>If you do not
            have a net terms account with AST, you may be
            required to guarantee payment by credit card and your
            credit card number will be required for each
            transaction. You may elect to participate in the
            Blanket Purchase Order Program for In-Warranty
            exchanges only. </b>Each exchange part must be
            returned to AST within 20 days of its ship date. If
            the part is still outstanding on the 21st day, AST
            will debit your warranty reimbursements or bill your
            credit card for the full ASC price, plus a $25.00
            cross-ship fee. If you are ordering in-warranty
            exchange parts with a Blanket Purchase Order and fail
            to return a part, the cost of that part plus the
            $25.00 fee will be deducted from your warranty
            reimbursements.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Please be sure to follow the
            requirements below to ensure the prompt handling of
            your order:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="2">1. RA should be prominently
                displayed.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">2. Return the same part number
                that was received.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">3. All parts and chips must be
                the same as originally sent, i.e. CPU and memory.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font size="2">If your part is received in a
            discrepant manner, it will be returned with a
            traveler indicating why the part is being denied. If
            the part is sent correctly within 20 days from the
            original ship date, your account will not be billed,
            nor will your warranty payments be debited.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">AST does not require proof of
            purchase when sending the COMPTIA (ABCD) form,
            although we may request it if the warranty of the
            computer cannot be verified.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>D.</b> If the component is not
            covered under the warranty, then you may be
            instructed to FAX the Purchase Order (PO) to
            817-230-5929. If you do not have a 30-day account
            with AST, you may pay for the repair with a credit
            card, or check. If this repair is exempt for
            sales-tax charges, please provide your Sales Tax
            Number.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>For AST Authorized Service Centers
        outside of the United States, if the component is not
        covered under warranty, you may pay for the repair with a
        credit card. After receiving your FAX, the CSR will
        figure the repair charges, call you with the total, and
        collect credit card payment at that time. If you need to
        contact the CSR for any questions, please call
        1-817-230-5800, Ext. 863 or Ext. 800.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The exchange process is available for
        out-of-warranty product for the cost of the component
        repair and an additional fee to cover cross-ship costs.
        This cross-ship fee is $25.00 for each part. Shipping
        charges are applicable. After AST receives the
        out-of-warranty payment plus the additional fee for the
        cross-ship, AST will ship the replacement part. (This fee
        is effective February 1, 1995.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">If the out-of-warranty part is returned
        unused, there will be a restocking fee of 20% of list
        price. Cross-ship fee is <b><u>non-refundable</u></b>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>AST Authorized Service Centers will </b><b><u>not</u></b><b>
        be paid for warranty work done on a cross-ship/exchange
        until the defective part is returned to AST Research,
        Inc., 1001 N.E. Loop 820, Dock # 5, Fort Worth, TX 76131.
        AST will pay for shipping charges (one way) to the
        Service Center on cross-ship/exchange parts. The Service
        Center is responsible for the cost and all liability of
        returning a part to AST. If parts have not been returned
        after a period of thirty (30) days, then the ASC can lose
        the privilege to cross-ship/exchange repair parts. If
        parts have not been returned after a period of sixty (60)
        days, then the ASC&#146;s account can be placed on hold.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>2.</b> To protect your
        customers&#146; investment in AST system enhancements, be
        sure to remove all options (e.g.: math co-processors) and
        non-AST components before sending products in for repair,
        unless the option is related to the problem. Such options
        may be lost or damaged during the repair process. There
        is <b><u>no</u></b> guarantee that these items will be
        returned, unless the option is related to the repair. <b>AST
        accepts no responsibility for customer-owned AST and/or
        non-AST options</b>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>3.</b> Describe the problem in
        writing and return any accessories only if they are
        related to the problem. For example, if the parallel port
        does not function correctly, be sure to return the
        parallel port adapter cable with the board.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>4.</b> Reference the RA issued to on
        all correspondence. Securely package all material to
        prevent shipping damage. The RAN must appear on the
        outside of the shipping carton. Shipping charges must be
        prepaid; COD&#146;s will not be accepted.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">All components being sent in for repair
        must be assigned an RA. If the component arrives without
        an RA printed on the outside of the package, it will be
        refused and returned to sender. RA&#146;s issued are only
        valid for sixty (60) days. Any RA in the AST database
        which has nothing received against it within sixty (60)
        days will be closed.</font></p>

        your returned component, you will need to call the AST
        RA/Status Team, by using the ASC Support Line at (800)
        288-4278, Option # 3,1. Turnaround times on repairs will
        vary. This time will be quoted at the time the RA is
        issued.</font></p>
