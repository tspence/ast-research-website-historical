<H1>On-Site Service Program<BR></H1><HR>
<P>
Every AST computer system is now covered
by one of the most comprehensive warranty programs in existence
today.  All Desktops and Servers with AST factory installed hard
drives will be covered by an On-Site Service Program.  Below is
a listing of the warranty coverage on AST Desktops and Servers.
<P>
<B> * On-Site Service applies to products
sold and serviced in the United States only.</B>
<P>
<B> * Only Advanced Support Systems
Centers (ASSC's) are authorized by AST to provide on-site service.
</B>
<P>
The <B>AST Premium (SE), Premmia SE
&amp; MTE Servers, and Manhattan P,V,G, and SMP families</B> are
typically used to handle mission critical applications for a company
or a department within a company.  Therefore, these systems now
carry a full <B>3-year On-Site Warranty</B>.
<P>
<B>AST Premmia, Bravo and Power Premium
systems</B> are our highly integrated
yet expandable desktop solutions designed to run today's most
demanding business applications.  These systems have a warranty
program that <B>combines the convenience of on-site service during
the first year of ownership and an additional two years of carry-in
service for a total of three years coverage. </B> If your customers
prefer the convenience of on-site service, On-Site Service Program
Upgrades can be purchased for up to three years of coverage from
date of product purchase.
<P>
As an AST ASC or ASSC, offering your
customers the AST On-Site Service Program Upgrades have the following
major benefits:
<P>
- A 3-year warranty commits the end
user to you for three years of service.
<P>
- ASCs and ASSCs will receive a discount
equal to 15% of the AST On-Site warranty upgrade (applies to Premmia,
Bravo, and Power Premium families only) selling price for every
On-Site upgrade sold.  Be sure to record your name and service
center number on the registration card.
<P>
- You can purchase the AST On-Site
warranty upgrades and use them to underwrite your own service
agreements.  The AST On-Site service upgrades  can be incorporated
as part of an on-site maintenance agreement you currently sell
to your customers. <BR>

<H2>Policies</H2>
<P>
The AST On-Site Service Program covers
product failures that occur during normal use of the product by
the end user.  These failures are corrected by the  ASSC at no
charge to the end user.  The ASSC making the repairs is reimbursed
by AST for parts and labor required to repair covered failures
under the terms and conditions of the AST Authorized Service Center
program (Warranty Reimbursement Procedure). An ASSC is also reimbursed
for travel if dispatched on-site by AST.  Failures resulting from
accident, abuse, misuse, modifications or unauthorized repairs
are excluded from coverage.
<P>
The AST On-Site Service warranty upgrades
can be purchased by contacting the AST Warranty Registration Department
at (800) 727-1278 (Option 3). Your 15% discount will be based
on the selling price of the upgrade. <B>The AST On-Site Upgrade
form is part of the product registration form and is included
in all system boxes.  The On-Site Service Program is not transferable.</B>
<P>
<B>AST systems with AST factory installed
hard drives are covered under the On-Site Service program.  On
an exception-only basis, with prior approval from a Field Engineer,
 an ASSC may buy a base model (3V) and install an AST hard drive,
then the system will carry the On-Site Service. The ASSC will
be responsible for registering the system for the customer with
the AST Warranty Registration Department.  If the system is configured
with a third party hard drive, the system will be covered but
the hard drive (or any third party components) will not..</B>
<P>
<B>There are no provisions to warrant
software under the On-Site Service program.</B>
<P>
AST  floppy drives, memory, etc. will
be covered under the On-Site service program if the upgrades were
installed by AST or an ASSC.  These upgrades will carry the same
warranty as the system unit for the remainder of that system unit
warranty, or 1 year of carry-in warranty, whichever is greater.
 <B>Keyboards, monitors, external speakers and pointing devices
will be exchanged directly with the end user. </B>AST will not
pay On-Site reimbursements for these items.
<H2>Procedure for Providing Service under
the AST On-Site Service Program</H2>
<P>
If you are an AST Advanced Systems
Support Center (ASSC) you are eligible to provide on-site warranty
repair service on these products at the request of AST or your
customers.  The program also provides you with the opportunity
to supplement your service revenue by offering your customers
service upgrade options including on-site maintenance outside
of the 100-mile radius of an AST Authorized On-Site Service location
and extended hours coverage.  Next business day, same-day fix
with 2 or 4-hour response time, and additional years of on-site
coverage are other options you can make available to your customers
for an additional fee.
<P>
By following the ASSC on-site provider
program instructions as detailed in these procedures, you will
receive an on-site visit reimbursement fee.
<P>
Customers in need of on-site warranty
service may contact an ASSC or AST Technical Support directly
at (800) 727-1278.<BR>

<P>
If a customer contacts you, please
follow the guidelines detailed below:
<P>
- As the first level of support, ASSC
will screen the call to determine whether the problem is related
to application software or a hardware malfunction.
<P>
- If problem is non-hardware related,
ASSC will resolve problem and close call.
<P>
- If problem is believed to be hardware
related, ASSC will contact AST ASSC support group (1-800-288-4278)
and notify an AST Technician of need to perform an on-site call
and request a replacement FRU, if needed.  ASSC must speak to
an AST Technician and receive an on-site call authorization number
or the ASSC may call or fax a request to open a work order with
the ASSC support administrator. This fax number is (817) 230-5925.
AST reserves the right to contact end user for verification of
on-site request.
<P>
- ASSC will contact AST upon completion
of call to close call.  AST may contact the contact end user to
verify on-site call was performed and to survey end user's satisfaction
with the service experience.
<P>
- ASSC will submit warranty reimbursement
claim for labor and on-site reimbursement.<BR>

<P>
If the customer contacts AST for service,
the following steps will take place:
<P>
- As the first level of support, AST
will screen the call to determine whether the problem is related
to application software or a hardware malfunction.
<P>
- If problem is non-hardware related,
AST will resolve problem and close call.
<P>
- If problem is believed to be hardware
related, the on-site provider on record for this customer will
be contacted and requested to accept the on-site dispatch.  If
you accept the dispatch request, you will be given an on-site
call authorization number and the replacement FRU as specified
by AST Technical Support will be cross-shipped to you.
<P>
- Upon receiving the part needed for
repair, you will promptly contact customer and arrange to repair
customer's system at customer location.
<P>
- ASSC will contact AST upon completion
of call to close call.  AST will contact end user to verify on-site
call was performed and to survey end user's satisfaction with
service experience.
<P>
- ASSC will submit warranty reimbursement
claim for labor and on-site reimbursement.<BR>

<P>
The AST On-Site Service Program is
committed to total customer satisfaction and an attempt will be
made to survey every customer to measure his/her satisfaction
with the service experience.  Any service center that does not
maintain the standards of excellence as defined by AST will not
be allowed to continue in the on-site program.
