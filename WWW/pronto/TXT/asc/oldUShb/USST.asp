<H2>The Role of Service Training</H2>
<A HREF='VIDEOKIT.DOC'>Download Order Form <BR></A>

<P>
AST's Service Training's role is to
train and certify technicians to perform warranty repairs on AST
computer systems. Our primary audience for this type of training
is microcomputer support personnel and field service technicians.
 Having a certified technician is one of the requirements for
a reseller who wants to participate in the AST Authorized Service
Center Program. 
<P>
Currently AST requires the completion
of A Certification as the foundation of training authorization.
A certification is a nationally recognized, industry-wide standard
that certifies the competency of individuals in the microcomputer
industry. These exams are open to anyone who wishes to take them
and are given at Drake/Sylvan Prometric Authorized Testing Centers
all over the country. For more information regarding the exams,
dates and locations you may call 1-800-77MICRO.<BR>

<P>
Technical courses on all product lines
are offered at AST Computer in Fort Worth, Texas. A course catalog
and class schedule is available on AST's Info-FAX at 1-800-926-1278
(request Catalog 9). In addition, videotape-based courses, CBT's
and other supplemental product material  offer the flexibility
and convenience of a self-paced training package that can enhance
the technicians' AST product knowledge.
<H2>The Objectives</H2>
<P>
The training objectives are linked
with AST's service philosophy that each computer product is to
be repaired to the major component level.  At the completion of
each self-study course, the student should understand the product
and what goes into it, be comfortable with disassembly and reassembly
of the system, and know how to troubleshoot the system to the
major component level.

<P>
Ordering information is available from
PC Service Source (1-800-464-2781) or call AST's InfoFAX at 1-800-926-1278

only. Please DO NOT return video training tests.<BR>

<P>
AST Authorized Resellers and Authorized Service Centers
may purchase training kits at a discount.<BR>

<H3>Video Format</H3>
<P>
All video training kits are offered
in two video formats.  The NTSC format is used in the U.S.A. and
Canada.  International video equipment will generally require
the PAL format.
