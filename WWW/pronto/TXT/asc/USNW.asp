<B>1</B>.
 When the customer
detects a problem, he/she will call AST's Product Support at 800-727-1278,
24 hours a day, seven days per week.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.</B> Describe
the issue to the AST technician; advise the technician if any
optional hardware has been changed since enrollment, and perform
diagnostic tasks requested by the technician.  <BR>

<P>
<B>3.</B>
After determining a hardware issue exists and confirming enrollment,
the AST Technician will verify end user's name, business or residence
street number/city/state/zip, telephone number, hours of operation,
best time to call and an alternate name/telephone number.  Then
the technician will dispatch a replacement unit for next business
day exchange.  Replacement units for calls concluding after 4:00
PM CST (Central Standard Time) will be dispatched the following
business day.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.</B>
A local Fedex (Wang in Canada) technician will pick-up the replacement
unit and call before 10:30 AM local time the business day following
dispatch to arrange an appointment to perform the exchange.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.</B>
The local technician will deliver the replacement unit to the
address specified in the AST dispatch.  The technician will swap
components (i.e. hard drive(s), PCMCIA cards, memory) as necessary
from the defective unit to the replacement unit and confirm the
replacement unit powers up.<BR>

The local technician will complete a checklist confirming the
swap has been successful.  The end user and local technician will
both sign the checklist.<BR>

<P>

We make the transfer as easy as possible.  The customer keeps
the replacement unit, while the technician will repackage the
non-functioning notebook and take it back to AST.<BR>
