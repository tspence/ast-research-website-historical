<H2>4.1 Introduction &amp; AST Philosophy</A><BR></H2>

AST Canada stocks the major system components to
optimize inventory productivity  and these are to be found in
the AST Canada Product Kit List. It has all the information you
need on service parts  and their retail prices. You may need to
transfer chips, etc. from the original part onto the replacement
to complete the service action.  When returning an item that was
cross-shipped the item returned to AST must be in the same configuration
as that which was shipped, unless special arrangements have been
made with AST Canada prior to shipping the replacement part.<BR>

<P>
Should you require additional parts information please
check Pronto Pro.  If Pronto Pro does not give you the answer
call the Service Call Centre .
<hr><H2><A NAME="toc42">4.2 Spare Parts Purchases</A><BR></H2>

 to deliver the required warranty turnaround times.<BR>

AST spare parts may be new or refurbished as equivalent
to new.  All will have been upgraded to the lowest acceptable
revision level.  All will be honored with a 90 day warranty or
the balance of the system unit warranty.<BR>

<P>
Please note that while parts from AST are in your

<H2><A NAME="toc43">4.3 Cross Shipping</A><BR></H2>
AST Canada will cross ship warranty parts.  AST Canada
reserves the right to substitute alternative parts with equivalent
function if they are available.  The spare part will be sent pre-paid
by AST. ASCs must use the  RAN number when returning defective
parts.  This will facilitate accurate receiving in the AST warehouse
and allow for prompt reimbursement.<BR>

<P>
AST spare parts may be new or refurbished equivalent
to new.  All will have been upgraded to the lowest acceptable
revision level.  All will be honored with a 90 day warranty or
the balance of the system unit warranty.<BR>

<P>
AST does not cross-ship consumable parts ie, mice,
cables, keyboards, CMOS batteries.  Please do not return these
parts to AST.<BR>

<B>Cross Shipment Conditions<BR>
</B>
<P>
You MUST return the defective or good item(s) within
5 days to avoid being invoiced.  AST considers the RAN request
as authority to invoice when the part is not returned within the
5 day period.  Parts received beyond 30 days will be returned
and the invoice will remain a receivable.<BR>

<P>
In order to ensure that your part is received properly,
please use the box in which the good part was received when returning
the defective part.  Please indicate the RAN number on the outside
of the box.  Discrepancies in receiving caused through improper
shipping of parts will be invoiced.<BR>

<P>
Cross-shipments to an ASC may be suspended should
parts not be returned as per above.<BR>

<P>
Fractures or cracks on LCD's are not covered under
warranty, nor are any parts that show signs of abuse or damage.
 Any cracked displays or damaged FRUS that are received by AST
will be billed back to the Service Center responsible for placing
the in-warranty exchange order.  Please notify your customers
immediately upon receipt of the damaged part that they are responsible
for the labor, transportation and parts corresponding to any repair
that fits the criteria as listed below from their warranty statement.
<BR>

<P>
On notebooks, look for indications of cracks or dents
on the outside case or corners, which are signals that the unit
has been dropped or shipped without proper packaging.  Indentations
or scratches on the membrane of the LCD may also indicate rough
or abusive handling.<BR>

<P>
All other FRUS should also be examined for cracks,
dents, or punctures.  Main logic boards should also be examined
for burn marks, water marks, and melted or broken cables and plastics.
<BR>

<P>
If a unit, screen assembly, or FRU arrives at AST
damaged, it is the responsibility of the Service Center to file
a claim with their carrier to compensate for any charges passed
back to them for the damage.<BR>
