    <h3>Initialization Strings </h3>
    <p>Modems generally use a series of AT commands, called initialization strings, to provide
    a good connection to another modem. Initialization strings are personal, and your best bet
    will be to contact your Internet service provider (ISP) to help you develop the best
    string that meets your needs. </p>
    <p>Listed below is a common initialization string for this modem:</p>
    <p>AT&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2 </p>
    <p>The following string will disable error correction and data compression:</p>
    <p>AT&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2/N0%C0 </p>
    <p>Note that /NO disables error correction, while %CO disables data compression.</p>
    <p>Often ISPs will have specific settings for you to select within a communication applet.
    The selection you make within these applets automatically configures the appropriate
    initialization string for you to use. For most communication applets you can select a Boca
    V.34 OnlineExpress. <font color="Red">Caution: Do not select a Boca V.34 modem or other
    Boca modem. These modems use a different command set that is not compatible with your
    modem. </font></p>
