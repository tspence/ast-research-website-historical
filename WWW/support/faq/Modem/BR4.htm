    <p><font face="default">This modem shipped with systems that were designed to function in a
    Windows® 95 operating system. AST also installed backup copies of the Boca modem drivers
    in the Create System Disk Utility/AST Disk Utility and in the CAB files
    (C:/WINDOWS/OPTIONS/CABS) on the hard drive. You can also download drivers from our Web
    site. Listed below is the file that you can download: </font></p>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/BROCKDRV.EXE"><font face="default">BROCKDRV.EXE</a>
    Boca/Rockwell Modem Drivers Win95, v1.3 </font></p>
    <p><font face="default">Follow this procedure to create the driver diskette:</font></p>
    <p><font face="default">1. Download BROCKDRV.EXE. </font></p>
    <p><font face="default">2. Save the file to an empty directory (e.g., TEMP).</font></p>
    <p><font face="default">3. Double-click on the BROCKDRV icon in the directory where you
    saved the file; this will expand the compressed files. </font></p>
    <p><font face="default">4. Double-click on the BRCKDRV icon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="default">5. Double-click on the INSTALL icon. There are two install icons;
    you should click on the icon with the gear picture in the icon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="default">6. Follow the on-screen procedures in the DOS box to create the
    driver disk.</font></p>

    <h3></b><font face="default">Other Operating Systems</font> </h3>
    <p><font face="default">AST intended, designed, and manufactured the systems that use this
    modem to function with a Windows 95 operating system. As a result we do not have other
    drivers for this modem. However, that does not mean the drivers are not available. </font></p>
    <p><font face="default">AST did include Windows® 3.1/DOS drivers on the driver disk you can
    make for the system, as well as within <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/BROCKDRV.EXE">BROCKDRV.EXE</a>.
    You should use the second INSTALL icon on the disk to install the modem drivers.
    Additionally, you may need to access System Setup and disable the Plug-and-Play operating
    system (PnP OS) within the Advanced Menu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="default">AST does not have Windows NT&#153; drivers for this particular
    modem; however, you may want to try the <a href="ftp://ftp.bocaresearch.com">Boca Research
    FTP</a> site. According to Microsoft, the Windows 95 INF files should also work for
    Windows NT ver. 4.0. You also may want to check the following Rockwell site for more
    information:</font></p>
