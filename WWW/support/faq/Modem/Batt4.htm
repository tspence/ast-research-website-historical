    <p>This modem shipped with systems that were designed to function in a Windows® 95
    operating system. AST also installed backup copies of the Boca modem drivers in the Create
    System Disk Utility/AST Disk Utility and in the CAB files (C:/WINDOWS/OPTIONS/CABS) on the
    hard drive. You can also download drivers from our Web site. Listed below is the file that
    you can download: </p>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/BATTDRV.EXE">BATTDRV.EXE</a> Win95 v4.27 Boca AT&amp;T
    Modem </p>
    <p>Follow this procedure to create the driver diskette: </p>
    <p>1. Download BATTDRV.EXE. </p>
    <p>2. Save the file to an empty directory (e.g., TEMP).</p>
    <p>3. Double-click on the BATTDRV icon in the directory where you saved the file; this
    will expand the compressed files. </p>
    <p>4. Double-click on the EXTRACT icon.</p>
    <p>5. Follow the on-screen procedures in the DOS box to create the driver disk.</p>

    <p>AST intended, designed, and manufactured the systems that use this modem to function
    with a Windows 95 operating system. As a result we do not have other drivers for this
    modem. However, that does not mean the drivers are not available. </p>
    <p>AST did include Windows® 3.1/DOS drivers on the driver disk you can make for the
    system, as well as within <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/">BATTDRV.EXE</a>. You can run
    MDMSETUP.EXE on the driver disk to install the DOS/Windows 3.x drivers. Additionally, you
    may need to access System Setup and disable the Plug-and-Play operating system (PnP OS)
    within the Advanced Menu. </p>
    <p>AST does not have Windows NT&#153; drivers for this particular modem; however, you may
    want to try the <a href="ftp://ftp.bocaresearch.com">Boca Research FTP</a> site. </p>
