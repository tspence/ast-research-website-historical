    <h3>Other Operating Systems </h3>
    <p>AST intended, designed, and manufactured the systems that use this modem to function
    with a Windows 95 operating system. As a result we do not have other drivers for this
    modem. However, that does not mean the drivers are not available.</p>
    <p>You can find Windows 3.x drivers on the following Web site:</p>
