    <p>This modem shipped with systems that were designed to function in a Windows® 95
    operating system. AST also installed backup copies of the Boca modem drivers in the Create
    System Disk Utility/AST Disk Utility and in the CAB files (C:/WINDOWS/OPTIONS/CABS) on the
    hard drive. </p>

    <h3></b>Other Operating Systems </h3>
    <p>AST intended, designed, and manufactured the systems that use this modem to function
    with a Windows 95 operating system. As a result we do not have other drivers for this
    modem. However, that does not mean the drivers are not available. </p>
    <p>AST did include Windows® 3.1/DOS drivers on the driver disk you can make for the
    system.You can run MDMSETUP.EXE on the driver disk to install the DOS/Windows 3.x drivers.
    Additionally, you may need to access System Setup and disable the Plug-and-Play operating
    system (PnP OS) within the Advanced Menu.
