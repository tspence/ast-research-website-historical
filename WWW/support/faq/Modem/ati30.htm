    <h5><strong>Is it possible to update the modem's speed with flash software?</strong></h5>
    <p>The modem does not have flashable update capabilities. It is not possible to update the
    speed capabilities with software.</p>
    <h5><strong>Is there a UART on the modem card?</strong></h5>
    <p>This modem does not include a UART on the modem. Instead the modem relies on a driver
    that intercepts COMM.DRV. The information is routed through a driver rather than a UART
    chip. </p>
    <h5><strong>I need to use the modem with a DOS-based application; what should I do?</strong></h5>
    <p>The Windows® 95, 32-bit driver included with this modem is designed to allow this
    modem to function in a DOS box. It is important that you configure the appropriate COM
    port and IRQ settings within the application to match the settings for the modem. You can
    check the current modem settings through the Windows Device Manager. </p>
    <h5><strong>I updated Windows 95 (i.e. installed Service Pack 2) and now the modem does
    not work; what should I do?</strong></h5>
    <p>At the factory, custom modem settings were incorporated in the Windows Registry. When
    you install an updated version of Windows 95, Windows will rebuild segments of the
    Registry. As a result, Windows will not recognize the ATI modem properly. To eliminate
    this problem, reinstall the modem drivers to reset the Registry settings.</p>
    <h5><strong>I replaced the ATI 300 series modem with a newer modem; why does the ATI modem
    cause a conflict?</strong></h5>
    <p>You need to remove the ATI drivers from the system if you install a new modem. Follow
    this procedure:</p>
    <p>1. Double-click on the System icon in the Windows Control Panel.</p>
    <p>2. Click on the Device Manager tab.</p>
    <p>3. Double-click on the Ports (COM &amp; LPT) entry.</p>
    <p>4. Click to highlight the 300 Series Fax-Modem device.</p>
    <p>5. Click on the Remove button. </p>
