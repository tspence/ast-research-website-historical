    <td><h3>Windows 95® Drivers</h3>
    <p>This modem shipped with systems that were designed to function in a Windows® 95
    operating system. AST also installed backup copies of the ATI modem drivers in the Create
    System Disk Utility/AST Disk Utility and in the CAB files (C:/WINDOWS/OPTIONS/CABS) on the
    hard drive. You can also download drivers from our Web site. Listed below is the file that
    you can download: </p>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/ATIATTDR.EXE">ATIATTDR.EXE</a> ATI/AT&amp;T Modem
    Drivers Win95, v1.0 </p>
    <p>Follow this procedure to create the driver diskette:</p>
    <p>1. Download ATIATTDR.EXE.</p>
    <p>2. Save the file to an empty (e.g., TEMP) directory.</p>
    <p>3. Double-click on the ATIATTDR icon.</p>
    <p>4. Double-click on the INSTALL icon.</p>
    <p>5. Insert a blank floppy disk in the floppy drive. </p>
    <p>6. Follow the on-screen procedures to create the diskette.</p>

    <h3>Other Operating Systems </h3>
    <p>AST intended, designed, and manufactured the systems that use this modem to function
    with a Windows 95 operating system. As a result we do not have other drivers for this
    modem. However, that does not mean the drivers are not available. </p>
    <p>This ATI modem uses the same chipset as a Boca (AT&amp;T chipset) modem. As a result,
    you can use the DOS/Windows 3.x driver as the Boca (AT&amp;T chipset). The DOS driver is
    contained within <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/MISC/">BATTDRV.EXE</a>. You can run
    MDMSETUP.EXE on the driver disk to install the DOS/Windows 3.x drivers. Additionally, you
    may need to access System Setup and disable the Plug-and-Play operating system (PnP OS)
    within the Advanced Menu. </p>
    <p>AST does not have Windows NT&#153;, OS/2 Warp, or Linux drivers for this modem.
