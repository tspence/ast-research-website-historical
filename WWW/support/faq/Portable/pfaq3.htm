<p>The trackstick controller has an embedded calibration routine to compensate for
temperature variations within the system. Often the cursor will drift if you touch the
trackstick in the calibration window. Since the calibration routine monitors the activity
of the trackstick, you will disrupt the calibration settings. If there is no trackstick
activity for eight seconds, the controller will initiate the calibration, which takes
approximately one millisecond to complete. If you touch the trackstick during this one
millisecond, the calibration routine will try to compensate for the voltage difference it
has just detected, causing the cursor to drift. </p>

<p>To correct a drifting cursor, you can reset the device by invoking a SUSPEND
&lt;Fn+Esc&gt; and RESUME &lt;any key&gt; operation. This change will reset the cursor
without the user losing any information. </p>

<p>Additionally, if you use a cellular phone near an AST Ascentia 900N notebook that is
running Windows 3.1, the cursor or mouse pointer may drift toward the edge of the screen.
The issue is the result of the Ascentia 900N's lower board. This board may act as an
antenna. As the system receives the cellular phone output signals it may feed the signals
into the mouse control circuitry; as a result, the circuit may interpret that the track
stick is being pushed, thus moving the mouse cursor. </p>

<p>The mouse cursor movement does not cause a problem in the Ascentia 900N system. The
trackstick still operates normally, even when it is close to a source of interference,
such as a cellular phone, cordless phone, or radio transceiver. Operate these devices at a
distance of at least two feet away from the Ascentia 900N to prevent the trackstick from
drifting.</p>

<p><a name="26"><b>Running in 800x600 resolution, my mouse stays about 1 inch above the
bottom of the screen on my Ascentia 950; what do I need to do?</b></a> </p>

<p></b>Follow these steps to resolve this issue: 

<ol>
  <li>Choose Display in Control Panel. </li>
  <li>Select the Settings tab.</li>
  <li>Select Change Monitor Type.</li>
  <li>Select &#147;Standard Monitor Type Laptop Display Panel (800x600).&#148; </li>
  <li>Choose OK, and then click Close.</li>
  <li>Choose 800x600 pixels on the Change Display Settings Screen,. </li>
  <li>Choose OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the display doesn't change after you complete these steps, shut down the computer,
reboot the computer, and then repeat steps 6 and 7.</p>

<p>These changes should resize the screen, and the mouse should function properly.<b></p>
