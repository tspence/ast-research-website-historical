<p><a name="2"><b>How can I prevent the cursor from drifting on my Ascentia?</b></a> </p>

<p>The trackstick controller has an embedded calibration routine to compensate for
temperature variations within the system. Often the cursor will drift if you touch the
trackstick in the calibration window. Since the calibration routine monitors the activity
of the trackstick, you will disrupt the calibration settings. If there is no trackstick
activity for eight seconds, the controller will initiate the calibration, which takes
approximately one millisecond to complete. If you touch the trackstick during this one
millisecond, the calibration routine will try to compensate for the voltage difference it
has just detected, causing the cursor to drift. </p>

<p>To correct a drifting cursor, you can reset the device by invoking a SUSPEND
&lt;Fn+Esc&gt; and RESUME &lt;any key&gt; operation. This change will reset the cursor
without the user losing any information. </p>

<p>Additionally, if you use a cellular phone near an AST Ascentia 900N notebook that is
running Windows 3.1, the cursor or mouse pointer may drift toward the edge of the screen.
The issue is the result of the Ascentia 900N's lower board. This board may act as an
antenna. As the system receives the cellular phone output signals it may feed the signals
into the mouse control circuitry; as a result, the circuit may interpret that the track
stick is being pushed, thus moving the mouse cursor. </p>

<p>The mouse cursor movement does not cause a problem in the Ascentia 900N system. The
trackstick still operates normally, even when it is close to a source of interference,
such as a cellular phone, cordless phone, or radio transceiver. Operate these devices at a
distance of at least two feet away from the Ascentia 900N to prevent the trackstick from
drifting.</p>

<p><a name="6">When I boot the computer, I get a message &quot;non system disk or disk
error.&quot; What should I do?</a> </p>

<p></b>Several factors can cause your system to display this message. First, check your
floppy drive. If there is a disk in the drive, remove it and press any key. </p>

<p>If there is no disk in the drive or you continue to receive the message, you may have
some damaged system files. Consider the following steps to restore the system files to
your system's hard drive: 

<ol>
  <li>Boot the system with Disk 1 of your DOS disks.</li>
  <li>Press &lt;F3&gt; to exit the DOS installation. </li>
  <li>Enter the following command at the A:\&gt; prompt : <br>
    SYS C: </li>
</ol>

<p>This command should restore your system files, and allow your hard drive to boot. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="9">Why does my PC Card (PCMCIA) not work after I run MEMMAKER? </a></strong></p>

<p>When you run MEMMAKER, it will try to configure your boot files for optimal use.
However, it will often change the EMM386 line of your CONFIG.SYS and disable the memory
range needed for PCMCIA use. AST systems require an exclusion of the entire D000 range.
Consider the following syntax for excluding that range: </p>

<p>DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=D000-DFFF </p>

<p>Some cards will not require you to exclude the entire range. Check with your PC card
vendor if you need more memory. </p>

<p>Also, MEMMAKER often adds the HIGHSCAN switch to the EMM386 line. If you see this
switch, remove it. Due to the added demands of power management in a portable system, AST
recommends removing HIGHSCAN from the EMM386 line. In most cases, HIGHSCAN will try to
force TSRs (terminate and stay resident programs) and other drivers into memory that are
normally used by other notebook functions. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="10">My Premium Exec / Advantage NB 386 notebook hangs after MS-DOS
6.2X has been installed. What should I do?</a></strong> </p>

<p>If the notebook hangs during the HIMEM.SYS extended memory text, follow this procedure:

<ol>
  <li>Turn on your system. As soon as you see the message, &quot;Starting MS-DOS...,&quot;
    press &lt;F5&gt;. <br>
    This should bypass your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.</li>
  <li>Enter the following command: <br>
    PATH=C:\DOS </li>
  <li>To edit your CONFIG.SYS file, enter the following command: <br>
    EDIT CONFIG.SYS </li>
  <li>Search the CONFIG.SYS file for the line that contains HIMEM.SYS. When you find the line,
    you will need to add the &quot;/TESTMEM:OFF&quot; switch. Your HIMEM.SYS line should be
    similar to the following example: <br>
    DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS /TESTMEM:OFF<br>
    This switch disables the memory test, which allows your system to boot without hanging.</li>
  <li>Save the file, exit the MS-DOS Editor, and reboot your system. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="12">My notebook will not power up when docked in the PowerStation Pro.
What should I do?</a> </strong></p>

<p>The PowerStation Pro has a plunger switch to establish a complete connection between
the notebook and the PowerStation Pro. If the back port-access door has been removed, the
plunger will not be depressed. As a result, the PowerStation Pro will not power up. The
back port access door must be in place and in the closed position. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="16">I have a ProStation Multimedia docking station, and an Ascentia
900N; why will the Toshiba CD-ROM not work in the ProStation?</a></strong> </p>

<p>Obtain the latest Toshiba CD-ROM drivers for the ProStation Multimedia Docking Station.
Listed below, is the file you can download:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/P-OTHER/807032.EXE">807032.EXE</a> Toshiba 4x CD-ROM
driver(s) v.2.00 </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="17">When I dock my Ascentia 900N and turn the power on my ProStation
will not power up, why?</a> </strong></p>

<p>You must have the rear-port door installed and closed for the computer to power on in
the ProStation. The only door that should be open is the expansion port cover. The main
door has to press the black switch on the ProStation before it will power on.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="20">I have Windows 95 on an Ascentia 910N and my PCMCIA Ethernet card
is hanging; what should I do?</a> </strong></p>

<p>Random data may be received when Windows 95 polls the VLSI controller for power
management status. This random data may lock up the system. To resolve this issue, disable
power status polling. Follow the steps below to disable power status polling: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Double-click the System icon.</li>
  <li>Click the Device Manager tab.</li>
  <li>Double-click the plus sign to expand the System Devices branch.</li>
  <li>Click Advanced Power Management, Properties, and Settings.</li>
  <li>Place a check in the box labeled &#147;Disable Power Status Polling.&#148;</li>
  <li>Click OK until you return to the Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Click Yes if prompted to restart your computer.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong><a name="21">Why doesn't my keyboard or mouse work in Windows for Workgroups? </a></strong></p>

<p>The Ascentia 900N system keyboard may hang or fail to operate properly under Windows
for Workgroups, version 3.11. This problem is caused by the way the keyboard controller
circuit is implemented on some systems. Install a separate keyboard driver which ignores
the extra interrupt signals generated by these keyboard controllers. Windows normally uses
an internal &quot;Virtual Keyboard Driver&quot; or VKD. </p>

<p>To install the new VKD.386 driver: 

<ol>
  <li>Download the following file: <br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/P-OTHER/VKD386.EXE">VKD386.EXE</a> <br>
    This self-extracting file will create the driver.</li>
  <li>Exit Windows.</li>
  <li>Copy the file VKD.386 to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. <br>
    Consider this example: <br>
    COPY A:\VKD.386 C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM </li>
  <li>Change to the Windows directory.<br>
    CD \WINDOWS </li>
  <li>Using the MS-DOS EDIT command to edit your SYSTEM.INI file: <br>
    EDIT C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI </li>
  <li>Search for the following line: KEYBOARD=*VKD. While in MS-DOS EDIT, press &lt;F3&gt;,
    and enter &quot;*VKD&quot; to find it. Change this line to read like the following
    example:<br>
    KEYBOARD=VKD.386 </li>
  <li>Save the SYSTEM.INI file. In MS-DOS EDIT, press
    &lt;ALT&gt;,&lt;F&gt;,&lt;S&gt;,&lt;Alt&gt;,&lt;F&gt;,&lt;X&gt;.</li>
  <li>Reboot your system and run Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The keyboard and mouse will now
    operate properly. </li>
