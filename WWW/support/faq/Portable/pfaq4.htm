</a></p>

<p>Make sure that you enable the Internal Adapter/Modem field in System Setup. In most
cases, you can enter System Setup by pressing the &lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt; combination during
boot. </p>

<p><a name="11"><b>How do I get a 3Com 3C509B Network Card to work in the PowerStation III
or PowerStation Pro?</b></a> </p>

<p>The configuration program for the adapter says that &quot;ALL THE PORTS ARE BEING
USED&quot; or &quot;THIS INTERRUPT IS IN USE, WOULD YOU STILL LIKE TO USE IT?&quot; If you
answer Yes to either of these errors and then run diagnostics on the card, the interrupt
will fail. </p>

<p>Consider the following procedure to resolve the problem: 

<ol>
  <li>Choose the port addressing and interrupt (IRQ) you would like to use. In general, port
    address 300 and IRQ 9 work best. </li>
  <li>Save the setup and DO NOT run diagnostics on the card! </li>
  <li>Exit the program and reboot the system. </li>
  <li>Reenter the configuration program, and run the diagnostics on the card. It should now
    pass all the tests.<b> </b></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="14"><b>Can I upgrade the internal modem for the Advantage! NB 486SX/33 to a
14.4Kbps or higher?</b></a> </p>

<p>This notebook uses an 8250 UART chip. The 8250 UART limits the speed of the serial port
to a maximum baud rate of 9600bps in Windows, and will not allow a 14.4Kbps or faster
external modem to operate reliably at a speed faster than 9600bps. The fastest modem AST
recommends is a 9600bps modem.</p>

<p><a name="20"><b>I have Windows 95 on an Ascentia 910N and my PCMCIA Ethernet card is
hanging; what should I do?</b></a> </p>

<p>Random data may be received when Windows 95 polls the VLSI controller for power
management status. This random data may lock up the system. To resolve this issue, disable
power status polling. Follow the steps below to disable power status polling: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Double-click the System icon.</li>
  <li>Click the Device Manager tab.</li>
  <li>Double-click the plus sign to expand the System Devices branch.</li>
  <li>Click Advanced Power Management, Properties, and Settings.</li>
  <li>Place a check in the box labeled &#147;Disable Power Status Polling.&#148;</li>
  <li>Click OK until you return to the Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Click Yes if prompted to restart your computer.</li>

<p>Download the RPI driver from Rockwell's Web site:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nb.rockwell.com/ref/rpi/" target="_new">http://www.nb.rockwell.com/ref/rpi/</a></p>

<p>The files you can download are listed below:</p>

<p>Windows 95 RPI driver: 95RPI115.ZIP</p>

<p>Windows 3.1x RPI driver: WRPI_226.ZIP</p>

<p>After you download the files, extract the file onto a floppy disk, and follow
directions in the README.TXT file.</p>

<p>How do I get the internal modem to work on my Ascentia J20?</p>

<p>The Ascentia J-20 does not have a built in modem. You need to purchase and install a
PCMCIA card or external modem.<font face="ARIAL"></p>
