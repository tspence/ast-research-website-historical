<p><a name="13"><b>How do I maintain optimal battery performance?</b> </a></p>

<p>There are several factors that can control that can determine the performance and life
of your battery.</p>

<p>If you run the system on AC power while the battery is still installed, you may shorten
the life of the battery. The battery will continue to charge if you leave the battery
inside the system and run the computer on AC power. If you do not need to use the mobile
features of the system, then remove the battery from the computer and run the system on AC
power. </p>

<p>If your portable system has a Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) or Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
battery, you should perform a full battery discharge after every one to two months. NiCad
and NiMH batteries will develop a &quot;memory&quot; if you do not regularly perform this
procedure. Although the &quot;memory&quot; effect are not as dramatic on NiMH batteries as
the effects on a NiCad batteries, the &quot;memory&quot; effects occur in both battery
types. </p>

<p>Follow this procedure to perform a deep battery discharge: 

<ol>
  <li>Turn the system off.</li>
  <li>Charge the system until your battery light disappears or indicates a trickle charge. </li>
  <li>Disconnect the AC adapter from the system. </li>
  <li>Turn on the system and use the it until the system shuts down. To expedite the
    discharge, you may want to enter System Setup and choose Max Performance in the Power
    Management settings. </li>
  <li>Repeat step four (4) until the system will not power up on battery power. </li>
  <li>With the system off, connect the AC adapter to the system and charge the battery for
    approximately one to two hours. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your battery should be refreshed and fully charged. </p>

<p>If your needs require that you use the battery extensively, you may want to consider
purchasing additional batteries as an insurance measure. Many applications are
disk-intensive, and can quickly drain a battery. Some batteries included with notebook
systems can use an external battery charger; this is another wise investment if you plan
to run the system on battery power for extended periods.</p>

suspend on my Ascentia J?</b></a></p>

<p>Enable Advanced Power Management in Windows 95. If you use Windows for Workgroups, then
install the DOS Advanced Power Management driver. </p>

<p><a name="31"><b>I get a &#147;Bat1 Gauge Unsure!&quot; message on my Ascentia P
computer, how do I fix this problem?</b></a> </p>

<p>This warning appears whenever the battery gauge cannot accurately measure the battery
charge because of too many partial discharges of the battery. A partial discharge occurs
when the AC adapter is connected before the battery charge is fully depleted. If this
occurs too many times, the battery gauge cannot fully calibrate itself. Follow the steps
below to resolve this issue:

<ol>
  <li>Turn off power management by pressing &lt;Fn+F5&gt;. </li>
  <li>Disconnect the AC adapter. </li>
  <li>Keep the unit's power on until the battery is completely discharged. If you continue to
    work, make sure you save your work once you received the battery-low warning. The battery
    is fully discharged when the computer beeps three times and the battery indicator light
    flashes twice per second. Your computer automatically goes into suspend mode. </li>
  <li>Fully charge the battery once your computer's power automatically turns off.</li>
</ol>
