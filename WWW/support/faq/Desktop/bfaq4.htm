    <p><a name="10">When I turn my system on there is no video and I hear two long beeps
    followed by three short beeps. What does this mean?</a></p>
    </b><p>The two long beeps followed by three short beeps often indicates that the CMOS is
    corrupted. Often this issue occurs with systems that have a flash BIOS. To resolve the
    issue, reflash the system&#146;s BIOS. If you require assistance with this procedure, or
    are uncertain which file to use, check the <a href="biostbls.htm">flash BIOS tables</a> or
    contact a <a href="suplines.htm">technical support representative</a> for assistance.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="11">My system issues three short beeps followed by five long beeps (possibly
    another series of short beeps). What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>This beep code generally indicates bad or incompatible memory in the system. If you
    recently added memory to the system, try removing it. Does the problem go away? What
    happens if you install the additional memory only? Does the system function normally?</p>
    <p>Check your system&#146;s memory specifications. Do you have the correct memory
    installed? Does your system use tin-lead or gold-lead RAM? It is typically not a good idea
    to mix gold-lead and tin-lead SIMMs (DIMMs). When you mix two different conductors
    together in the same computer you can cause galvanization to areas on the system board.</p>
    <p>Also, check your system&#146;s memory configuration tables. You can usually find this
    table with the system's User's Manual. Some system boards require that you install memory
    using specific configurations (e.g., install the largest SIMMs first, etc). If you are
    uncertain as to which type of memory your system requires, or cannot find the correct
    configuration table, contact a <a href="suplines.htm">technical support representative</a>
    for assistance.</p>

    with the CMD IDE controller. What do I need to do to resolve this issue?</a></p>
    </b><p>If the conflict is on the CMD controller itself, you will need to follow the
    procedure outlined below: <ol>
      <li>Click on the Start button, select Programs, and MS-DOS Prompt to open up a DOS box. </li>
      <li>Change directories so that you are in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.</li>
      <li>Rename the PCI.VXD file.</li>
      <li>Copy the PCIIDE.VXD file from the Windows 95 CD-ROM into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.</li>
      <li>Rename the PCIIDE.VXD file to PCI.VXD.</li>
      <li>Close the DOS box.</li>
      <li>Access the Device Manager.</li>
      <li>Remove each and every controller from Device Manager by clicking on Properties, and then
        remove the check from the box labeled Original Configuration. Return to Device Manager,
        highlight the device, and click on the Remove button.</li>
      <li>Exit Windows 95, and then shut down your computer. </li>
      <li>Reboot the computer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Windows 95 should properly recognize the primary IDE controller, and 32-bit disk access
    should be re-enabled.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="16">Device Manager in Windows® 95 displays a conflict for the primary IDE
    controller (secondary IDE controller). What do I need to do to resolve this conflict?</a></p>
    </b><p>There are two articles in Microsoft&#146;s Knowledge Base that offer interesting
    insights to the possible cause of the conflict. </p>
    <p><b>If the conflict is not with the CMD controller, as described in the previous
    question, then the first article may be helpful: </b></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q151/9/11.htm" target="_new">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q151/9/11.htm</a></p>
    <p>As an additional note to the aforementioned article, if the NOIDE entry returns after
    you remove the NOIDE entry in the Registry and reboot the system, then the Registry may be
    corrupt. You need to reinstall Windows 95 to resolve the issue.</p>
    <p><b>If the computer hangs when you re-enable the CMD PCI IDE controller, consider the
    following article:</b><br>
    <br>

    <p><a name="17">I installed Windows® 95 on my Bravo MS/MS-T 6180/6200 system, and then
    Windows failed to recognize the CD-ROM drive. What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>The retail version of Windows® 95 did not ship with the driver for the Intel
    82371SB PIIX3 IDE controller used in these systems. The following document on Intel&#146;s
    Web site addresses the issue in depth:</p>
    <p><a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/IDEINFUP.HTM" target="_new">http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/IDEINFUP.HTM</a></p>
    <p>Intel also provides a link to a utility that will install the correct driver for the
    IDE controller. Alternatively, you can download <a
    href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/MSHDC.INF">MSHDC.INF</a>, and use the following procedure
    to resolve this issue: <ol>
      <li>Open the Device Manager, expand the Hard Drive Controllers entry, and remove all
        controllers from the list. </li>
      <li>Insert the diskette with MSHDC.INF in the floppy drive.</li>
      <li>Double-click on the My Computer icon.</li>
      <li>Double-click on the icon for the floppy drive.</li>
      <li>Right-click on MSHDC.INF and click on INSTALL. </li>
      <li>Shutdown the system, and then turn it off.</li>
      <li>Open the cover for the computer, and then clear the CMOS Setup by changing the jumper
        located at J6D1. You will need to remove the jumper that is set to pins 20-22, and
        reinstall it on pins 18-20. Leave the cover off. </li>
      <li>Turn on the computer. You will see an error message that indicates the CMOS has been
        cleared.</li>
      <li>Turn off the computer, and then reset jumper J6D1 back to pins 20-22. Return the cover
        to the system.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After you turn the system on, the new MSHDC.INF should correctly identify the
    controller. It may respond with a message that Windows 95 has detected new hardware and
    ask you to install a driver for it. Do not install the default driver; this is what you
    just removed. You need to inform Windows to install the driver from your floppy diskette,
    and then install the Intel 82371SB driver for the primary IDE controller. Reboot the
    system again; it should now detect the secondary controller and the CD-ROM drive. If
    Windows fails to recognize the drive, then you may need to repeat the procedure.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="18">I received a 10.01 text-error message when I boot the computer. What is
    wrong?</a></p>
    </b><p>The 10.01 error message indicates the bootable partition is not active. The Primary
    DOS Partition was not set as an active partition</p>
    <p>Follow these steps to make the bootable partition on your system active: <ol>
      <li>Boot the computer from a bootable DOS diskette.</li>
      <li>Enter FDISK at the DOS prompt .</li>
      <li>Choose &quot;2. Set active partition.&quot;</li>
      <li>Choose &quot;partition one,&quot; the Primary DOS Partition. FDISK will activate the
        partition and return to the FDISK menu options screen.</li>
      <li>Press <b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b> to exit FDISK.</li>
      <li>Turn off the computer, and take the bootable DOS diskette out of the drive. Reboot the
        computer and your hard drive should be recognized properly.</li>

    <p><a name="19">My AST desktop system does not recognize a second hard drive I added to
    the system. What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>If the system has two IDE controllers (primary and secondary), you will need to
    determine the best configuration for your needs. Typically, the optimal drive performance
    configuration will have both hard drives installed on the primary controller and the
    CD-ROM drive (if present) on the secondary controller. </p>
    <p>Make sure that you configure the appropriate &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;
    jumper settings on both drives. If either drive is jumpered to be a Single, or both are
    jumped as Master (or Slave), the system will not correctly recognize the drives. Most hard
    drive manufacturers silk screen a jumper setting diagram or include a sticker on the drive
    that will help you set the appropriate jumper setting.</p>
    <p>Make sure the drives are properly identified in System Setup. Unless you have an older
    286 or 386 AST desktop system, you should set the hard disk to &quot;Auto.&quot; This
    setting will allow the BIOS to detect and configure most hard drives using Logical Block
    Addressing (LBA). <i>Note: LBA does not use the same drive parameters as ECHS (Enhanced
    Cylinders Heads and Sectors). The numbers of cylinders, sectors and heads in System Setup
    will not match the ECHS parameters recommended by the drive&#146;s manufacturer. That is
    not a problem; in fact, most drive manufacturers recommend using LBA if it is available.</i></p>
    <p>Another issue you may encounter is drive incompatabilities. A drive from one
    manufacturer may not function with a drive from another manufacturer when attached to the
    same IDE controller. Some drives will work with only one configuration. If you use hard
    drives from different drive manufacturers, contact the manufacturers and find out if there
    are any known issues between the two drives you own. Listed below are some links to some
    common drive manufacturers:</p>

    <p>Make sure that you cable the drives properly. You may want to keep an extra cable
    handy; often a faulty IDE cable can be mistaken for a bad hard drive. It is less expensive
    to purchase another IDE cable than it is to buy or replace a hard drive.</p>
    <p>Be aware of any operating system limitations. MS-DOS and early versions of Windows® 95
    use a FAT 16 file system. This file system will recognize up to a 2GB partition. If the
    drive you install is larger than 2GB, then you need to partition the drive accordingly.
    Depending on the file system (FAT or NTFS) that you use with the Windows NT&#153; Server
    and Windows NT&#153; Workstation operating systems, the size of the drive and partitions
    you can use will vary. For more information, check Article IDs: Q114841, Q119497, Q155615,
    Q153941 on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge
    Base</a>. For more information about FAT, HPFS, and NTFS, refer to article Q100108 on the <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
    <p>Do not forget to format the drive! The majority of most drive manufacturers require
    that you format the new drive when you first install it in the system. Often the drive
    will not be accessible, or you will see an error message stating &quot;The device is not
    functioning properly!&quot; until you format the drive. Be sure that you specify the
    correct drive letter or you may format the original drive that came with the system. </td>
