        system. How do I access this field?</a></p>
        </b><p>When you first run the EISA Configuration Utility, several fields are extracted
        from System Setup that are only accessible when you run the EISACU program. If the hard
        drive field is not present in your system&#146;s CMOS Setup program, you will need to run
        EISACU to access that field.</p>

        <p>AST used two different BIOS chips with Premium/286 systems. Early versions of this
        system shipped with a Phoenix BIOS, while the later systems shipped with an AST BIOS. Each
        of these different BIOS versions require different utility diskettes to access the CMOS
        Setup utility, &quot;ASTSETUP.&quot; Premium/286 systems that use the Phoenix BIOS do not
        offer the setup routine within the ROM BIOS. You must access ASTSETUP from the utility
        diskette. </p>
        <p>Change to the drive containing the diskette and enter ASTSETUP. </p>
        <p><b>If your AST system has an older Phoenix BIOS, you can download <a
        href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/DIAGS35.ARC">DIAGS35.ARC</a>. You will need to use the
        ARC600.EXE file to unzip the DIAGS35.ARC file. Both of these files can be downloaded from
        our BBS. <br>
        The phone number for our BBS is:</b></p>
        <p>(817) 230-6850</p>
        <p>After you enter your account information, type F (for Files) on the first screen, and D
        (for Download) on the second. Enter the name of the file that you want to download;
        download the file via Z-Modem.</p>
        <p><b>If your Premium/286 has an AST BIOS, then there are two methods to access ASTSETUP. </b></p>
        <p>To access ASTSETUP from the Utility diskette, change to the drive containing the
        diskette and enter ASTSETUP. If you need a copy of the utility diskette, download the
        following file:</p>
        <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/PR286.ZIP">PR286.ZIP</a></p>
        <p>You can use an alternate method to access ASTSETUP without diskette on a system that
        has the AST BIOS. Reboot the computer and hold down any key on the keyboard to force a
        keyboard error. The system will respond with a message that should prompt you to press
        either &lt;F1&gt; or &lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt; for Setup.</p>
        <b><hr>
        <p><a name="7">How do I access System (CMOS) Setup on my AST computer?</a></p>
        </b><p>On most AST systems, you should see a message during a cold boot that prompts you
        for a series of keystrokes allowing you to access the System Setup. The majority of AST
        systems use the <b>&lt;Ctrl</b>+<b>Alt</b>+<b>Esc&gt;</b> keystrokes. On some AST systems,
        this feature is available on both warm and cold boots. The following table outlines the
        other exceptions to this rule:</p>

        <p><a name="8">I downloaded a BIOS update; how do I use it? </a></p>
        </b><p>Before you install a BIOS update, you should always make sure you downloaded the
        appropriate file. Always consult the <a href="biostbls.htm">flash BIOS tables</a> for the
        latest BIOS update. If you are unsure about a BIOS update, then contact a <a
        href="/suplines.htm">technical support representative </a>for more information. Listed
        below is a procedure you should follow once you download a BIOS update: </p>
        <p><i>Note: This procedure refers to the root directory of the hard drive as C:/&gt; . If
        applicable, substitute a different drive letter.</i></p>
        <p><i>Note: Not all BIOS updates follow this exact procedure. Always check the README.TXT
        file contained within the compressed BIOS file for any information about the BIOS update.</i><ol>
          <li>Create a /TEMP directory on your hard drive. </li>
          <li>Copy the BIOS update file that you downloaded to this empty directory. </li>
          <li>Enter the following command at the DOS prompt: <br>
            CD/TEMP </li>
          <li>Enter the name of the file that you downloaded at the C:/TEMP&gt; prompt. When you enter
            this command you will extract the files contained within this compressed file. </li>
          <li>Enter &quot;EXTRACT&quot; or double click on the EXTRACT icon. You will see instructions
            to place a formatted 3.5&quot; floppy diskette in your A: drive. </li>
          <li>Follow the on-screen procedures to extract the flash BIOS update to the diskette in
            drive A:. </li>
          <li>Remove the new BIOS update diskette, reboot the computer, and enter System (CMOS) Setup.
          </li>
          <li>Insert the BIOS diskette in the A: drive, and then select the &quot;Update BIOS&quot;
            from the Advanced Options menu. </li>
          <li>Select &quot;Save changes, exit, and update BIOS.&quot; This option will reboot the
            computer and read the flash diskette in the A: drive. Following the beep codes, the BIOS
            will update and then the system should reboot, saving the changes. </li>
