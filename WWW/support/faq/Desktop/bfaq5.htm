    </b><p>Make sure the integrated ethernet controller is enabled and configured correctly in
    System Setup. The AMD Ethernet controller should be configured for IRQ 9, DMA 7, and I/O
    address 300. The AMD Ethernet controller can be configured in the Ethernet section of
    System Setup. Make sure no other installed devices are using the aforementioned settings.</p>
    <p>Listed below are the available drivers for the AMD Ethernet controller:</p>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/11265315.EXE">11265315.EXE PCNet Drv v2.52
    NDIS,NDIS3,ODI,Packet Drivers</a><br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/11265316.EXE">11265316.EXE PCNet Drv v2.52
    Novell/Packet/Generic Boot ROM</a><br>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/11265317.EXE">11265317.EXE PCNet Drv v2.52 SCO UNIX
    Driver</a></p>
    <p>The only AMD drivers that are available are the drivers that ship with Windows NT&#153;
    4.0. The AMD 2100/1500 driver is the correct driver. Check the resource settings in the
    BIOS and make sure that the IRQ, I/O Address and DMA settings are not used by other
    devices.</p>
    <p>Windows® 95 should automatically detect the ethernet controller as an AMD1500/2100T.</p>

    desktop system. What do I need to do to make this card work?</a></p>
    </b><p>If are installing a token ring card in a desktop that has an integrated audio
    chipset, then make sure the card uses an interrupt other than IRQ5. AST uses this IRQ
    setting for the audio chipset in all of our systems that have an integrated audio chipset.
    If it is essential to use this IRQ, then your option is to disable the integrated audio
    chipset.</p>
    <p>Additionally, all token ring cards use the default I/O address, A20. In our desktop
    systems that ship with an ATI mach64 video chipset, you need to change this address to
    A24. This change will eliminate any conflicts with the I/O addresses used by the video
    chipset.</td>
