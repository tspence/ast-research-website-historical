    <p><a name="12">How do I enable the integrated SCSI controller on my Premmia GX system?</a></p>
    </b><p>Make sure that the device is enabled in System (CMOS) Setup. To access System Setup
    on the Premmia GX, press <b>&lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt;</b> from a cold boot. Access the field
    entitled SCSI, and make sure the controller is Enabled. If it is Disabled, it will not
    work.</p>
    <p>The drivers that you will need to load for the SCSI controller will depend on the
    operating system you are using. The Windows® 95 drivers for the NCR SCSI controller are
    available from the Symbios Logic site:</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="http://www.symbios.com" target="_new"><img border="0"

    address 300. The AMD Ethernet controller can be configured in the Ethernet section of
    System Setup. Make sure no other installed devices are using the aforementioned settings.</p>
    <p>Listed below are the available drivers for the AMD Ethernet controller:</p>

    </b><p>The Premmia GX is designed to be upgraded with an identical second processor for
    use as a multi-processor system. For instance, if your Premmia GX system shipped with a
    90MHz Pentium® processor, you can install an additional 90MHz Pentium processor. AST does
    not support processor upgrades to faster Pentium processors, with the following exception:
    </p>
    <p>If the part number of your Premmia GX system begins with the numbers 501700-???, the
    90MHz processor(s) may be replaced with a 100MHz Pentium processor. Jumper changes are
    required for this upgrade; refer to your user&#146;s manual, or contact one of our support
    representatives if you need assistance or more detailed information.</p>
    <p>Please note that in order for the second processor to be &#147;active&#148;, you must

    <p><a name="17">I installed Windows® 95 on my Bravo MS/MS-T 6180/6200 system, and then
    Windows failed to recognize the CD-ROM drive. What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>The retail version of Windows® 95 did not ship with the driver for the Intel
    82371SB PIIX3 IDE controller used in these systems. The following document on Intel&#146;s
    Web site addresses the issue in depth:</p>
    <p><a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/IDEINFUP.HTM" target="_new">http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/IDEINFUP.HTM</a></p>
    <p>Intel also provides a link to a utility that will install the correct driver for the
    IDE controller. Alternatively, you can download <a
    href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/MSHDC.INF">MSHDC.INF</a>, and use the following procedure
    to resolve this issue: <ol>
      <li>Open the Device Manager, expand the Hard Drive Controllers entry, and remove all
        controllers from the list. </li>
      <li>Insert the diskette with MSHDC.INF in the floppy drive.</li>
      <li>Double-click on the My Computer icon.</li>
      <li>Double-click on the icon for the floppy drive.</li>
      <li>Right-click on MSHDC.INF and click on INSTALL. </li>
      <li>Shutdown the system, and then turn it off.</li>
      <li>Open the cover for the computer, and then clear the CMOS Setup by changing the jumper
        located at J6D1. You will need to remove the jumper that is set to pins 20-22, and
        reinstall it on pins 18-20. Leave the cover off. </li>
      <li>Turn on the computer. You will see an error message that indicates the CMOS has been
        cleared.</li>
      <li>Turn off the computer, and then reset jumper J6D1 back to pins 20-22. Return the cover
        to the system.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After you turn the system on, the new MSHDC.INF should correctly identify the
    controller. It may respond with a message that Windows 95 has detected new hardware and
    ask you to install a driver for it. Do not install the default driver; this is what you
    just removed. You need to inform Windows to install the driver from your floppy diskette,
    and then install the Intel 82371SB driver for the primary IDE controller. Reboot the
    system again; it should now detect the secondary controller and the CD-ROM drive. If
    Windows fails to recognize the drive, then you may need to repeat the procedure.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="19">My AST desktop system does not recognize a second hard drive I added to
    the system. What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>If the system has two IDE controllers (primary and secondary), you will need to
    determine the best configuration for your needs. Typically, the optimal drive performance
    configuration will have both hard drives installed on the primary controller and the
    CD-ROM drive (if present) on the secondary controller. </p>
    <p>Make sure that you configure the appropriate &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;
    jumper settings on both drives. If either drive is jumpered to be a Single, or both are
    jumped as Master (or Slave), the system will not correctly recognize the drives. Most hard
    drive manufacturers silk screen a jumper setting diagram or include a sticker on the drive
    that will help you set the appropriate jumper setting.</p>
    <p>Make sure the drives are properly identified in System Setup. Unless you have an older
    286 or 386 AST desktop system, you should set the hard disk to &quot;Auto.&quot; This
    setting will allow the BIOS to detect and configure most hard drives using Logical Block
    Addressing (LBA). <i>Note: LBA does not use the same drive parameters as ECHS (Enhanced
    Cylinders Heads and Sectors). The numbers of cylinders, sectors and heads in System Setup
    will not match the ECHS parameters recommended by the drive&#146;s manufacturer. That is
    not a problem; in fact, most drive manufacturers recommend using LBA if it is available.</i></p>
    <p>Another issue you may encounter is drive incompatabilities. A drive from one
    manufacturer may not function with a drive from another manufacturer when attached to the
    same IDE controller. Some drives will work with only one configuration. If you use hard
    drives from different drive manufacturers, contact the manufacturers and find out if there
    are any known issues between the two drives you own. Listed below are some links to some
    common drive manufacturers:</p>

    <p>Make sure that you cable the drives properly. You may want to keep an extra cable
    handy; often a faulty IDE cable can be mistaken for a bad hard drive. It is less expensive
    to purchase another IDE cable than it is to buy or replace a hard drive.</p>
    <p>Be aware of any operating system limitations. MS-DOS and early versions of Windows® 95
    use a FAT 16 file system. This file system will recognize up to a 2GB partition. If the
    drive you install is larger than 2GB, then you need to partition the drive accordingly.
    Depending on the file system (FAT or NTFS) that you use with the Windows NT&#153; Server
    and Windows NT&#153; Workstation operating systems, the size of the drive and partitions
    you can use will vary. For more information, check Article IDs: Q114841, Q119497, Q155615,
    Q153941 on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge
    Base</a>. For more information about FAT, HPFS, and NTFS, refer to article Q100108 on the <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
    <p>Do not forget to format the drive! The majority of most drive manufacturers require
    that you format the new drive when you first install it in the system. Often the drive
    will not be accessible, or you will see an error message stating &quot;The device is not
    functioning properly!&quot; until you format the drive. Be sure that you specify the
    correct drive letter or you may format the original drive that came with the system. </p>

    <p><a name="20">I would like to add another floppy drive to my system; is there anything I
    should be aware of?</a></p>
    </b><p>Make sure that the grey cable that connects the floppy drives to the system board
    is attached securely to the end connector on the floppy cable. If you have a cable
    reversed, the light on the floppy drive will often stay on continuously. </p>
    <p>Floppy drives are &quot;sensitive&quot; to their edge connector &quot;position&quot; on
    the grey floppy cable; in other words the floppy drive on the end of the cable is usually
    the &quot;A:\&quot; floppy drive and the drive on the secondary connector will be the
    &quot;B:\&quot; floppy drive. Make sure that the drives are jumpered (or switched)
    correctly to identify their respective positions on the floppy cable. You will need to
    specify the drive attached to the end connector as the drive 1 position. Refer to the
    following graphic for more information:</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../images/cable.jpg" width="434" height="231"></p>
    <p>Additionally, make sure that the drive is properly configured within System (CMOS)
    Setup. Make sure the CMOS settings that identify the floppy drives are correct for each
    drive and drive position. If you are using an add-in floppy controller, make sure that you
    change the Floppy Adapter to Add-in.</p>

    <p><a name="25">I have installed some 8MB SIMMs into my Bravo LC 486 system, but they only
    seem to be recognized as 4MB SIMMs, why?</a></p>
    </b><p>At the time of manufacture, Bravo LC 486 systems were built to recognize
    single-sided memory. Since most 2MB, 8MB, and 32MB SIMMs are double-sided, the system may
    not recognize the upgrade.</p>

    <p><a name="26">In my Bravo MS/MS-T system, I am having problems installing an internal
    modem in Windows® 95. What do I need to do?</a></p>
    </b><p>Windows 95 will auto-add an integrated COM port even though the COM ports are
    disabled within System (CMOS) Setup. This feature will often cause problems when you
    attempt to add an internal modem on COM1 or COM2. </p>
    <p>To resolve this problem, disable one of the serial ports (preferably COM2) to free up
    the resources for the modem. Configure the modem to use COM2 and IRQ3. Next, disable COM2
    within the Windows Device Manager to eliminate any conflicts. These conflicts may occur
    because of Windows 95 Plug-and-Play capabilities. After the BIOS hands over the
    responsibility of the system's configuration to the Plug-and-Play operating system, the
    serial ports are detected again even when they are disabled in System Setup.</p>
    <p>Consider the following procedure to install the modem: <ol>
      <li>Disable COM2 in System Setup. Press the &lt;<b>Ctrl+Alt+Esc</b>&gt; key combination
        after a cold boot to access System Setup. Under the Ports option, set Serial Port 2 to
        Disabled. </li>
      <li>Start Windows 95 and then access the Device Manager.</li>
      <li>Select COM2 under Ports.</li>
      <li>Click on Properties.</li>
      <li>Remove the check from the box labeled &quot;Original Configuration.&quot;</li>
      <li>Click OK to return to Device Manager. Do not Remove COM2. It should have a red X next to
        it. Leave it just like this.</li>
      <li>Open Control Panel.</li>
      <li>Select Add New Hardware.</li>
      <li>Allow Windows to auto-detect new hardware. Windows should find the COM port.</li>
      <li>Select Add New Hardware again. This time, do not allow Windows to auto-detect new
        hardware. </li>
      <li>Choose your modem from the list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once Windows notifies the Registry that the modem has been added, you may need to
    reboot the computer to use the modem.</p>

    <p><strong><a name="28">What is AST's stance on Cupid upgradability?</a></strong> </p>
    <p><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p>
    <p>AST's proprietary 32-bit interface, CUPID architecture, links plug-in processor boards
    and memory expansion boards with the computer's system board. CUPID stands for Completely
    Universal Processor Input/Output Design. Several AST products, including the Premium and
    CUPID lines of desktop and tower computers, utilize CUPID architecture. </p>
    <p><b>BACKGROUND </b></p>
    <p>Most of the personal computers designed around the same time contained interdependent
    components, making upgradability virtually impossible. With the development of new,
    improved components, the user would have to replace the entire system in order to take
    advantage of new technology. </p>
    <p>AST designed CUPID architecture to allow customers to purchase the right level of
    computer performance for their current needs. In the future, the customer could increase
    processing power without having to endure the inconvenience of replacing the entire
    system. CUPID technology placed the components most likely to require upgrading on a
    removable processor board. Those components that typically remain constant resided on a
    separate system board. The user could upgrade the performance by simply replacing a
    plug-in processor board or adding SIMMs to a memory expansion board. </p>
    <p><b>CUPID TODAY </b></p>
    <p>AST introduced CUPID architecture well over six years ago, which is an extended period
    of time and technological advancement in the computer industry. In 1987, a 486 system was
    street priced at $10,000, so a $3,000 upgrade offered a viable alternative. Unfortunately,
    the cost of reproducing that technology remains the same, while the price of new
    technology is dropping drastically. These CUPID upgrade prices have not been well received
    by our customers. In the customer's own words, &quot;I could buy a whole new system for
    that price!&quot; </p>
    <p>AST realizes that the feasibility of upgrading to the higher performance processors
    with CUPID architecture is NOT competitive in today's marketplace. After thoroughly
    evaluating both AST and non-AST solutions to provide price competitive alternatives to
    CUPID upgrades, AST has decided not to invest additional engineering resources researching
    CUPID board redesign and third party compatible alternatives. In essence, AST will no
    longer offer CUPID processor and memory board upgrades. AST regrets the inconvenience that
    this decision may cause our users with CUPID systems.</td>
