    <p><strong><a name="6">How do I access System (CMOS) Setup on my Premium 286 system?</a> </strong></p>
    <p>AST used two different BIOS chips with Premium/286 systems. Early versions of this
    system shipped with a Phoenix BIOS, while the later systems shipped with an AST BIOS. Each
    of these different BIOS versions require different utility diskettes to access the CMOS
    Setup utility, &quot;ASTSETUP.&quot; Premium/286 systems that use the Phoenix BIOS do not
    offer the setup routine within the ROM BIOS. You must access ASTSETUP from the utility
    diskette. </p>
    <p>Change to the drive containing the diskette and enter ASTSETUP. </p>
    <p><b>If your AST system has an older Phoenix BIOS</b>, you can download <a
    href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/DIAGS35.ARC">DIAGS35.ARC</a>. You will need to use the
    ARC600.EXE file to unzip the DIAGS35.ARC file. Both of these files can be downloaded from
    our BBS. <br>
    The phone number for our BBS is:</p>
    <p>(817) 230-6850</p>
    <p>After you enter your account information, type F (for Files) on the first screen, and D
    (for Download) on the second. Enter the name of the file that you want to download;
    download the file via Z-Modem.</p>
    <p><b>If your Premium/286 has an AST BIOS</b>, then there are two methods to access
    ASTSETUP. </p>
    <p>To access ASTSETUP from the Utility diskette, change to the drive containing the
    diskette and enter ASTSETUP. If you need a copy of the utility diskette, download the
    following file:</p>
    <p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/D-OTHER/PR286.ZIP">PR286.ZIP</a></p>
    <p>You can use an alternate method to access ASTSETUP without diskette on a system that
    has the AST BIOS. Reboot the computer and hold down any key on the keyboard to force a
    keyboard error. The system will respond with a message that should prompt you to press
    either <b>&lt;F1&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt;</b> for Setup.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="7">How do I access System (CMOS) Setup on my AST computer?</a></p>
    </b><p>On most AST systems, you should see a message during a cold boot that prompts you
    for a series of keystrokes allowing you to access the System Setup. The majority of AST
    systems use the <b>&lt;Ctrl</b>+<b>Alt</b>+<b>Esc&gt;</b> keystrokes. On some AST systems,
    this feature is available on both warm and cold boots. The following table outlines the

    <p><a name="8">I downloaded a BIOS update; how do I use it? </a></p>
    </b><p>Before you install a BIOS update, you should always make sure you downloaded the
    appropriate file. Always consult the <a href="biostbls.htm">flash BIOS tables</a> for the
    latest BIOS update. If you are unsure about a BIOS update, then contact a <a
    href="suplines.htm">technical support representative </a>for more information. Listed
    below is a procedure you should follow once you download a BIOS update: </p>
    <p><i>Note: This procedure refers to the root directory of the hard drive as C:\&gt; . If
    applicable, substitute a different drive letter.</i></p>
    <p><i>Note: Not all BIOS updates follow this exact procedure. Always check the README.TXT
    file contained within the compressed BIOS file for any information about the BIOS update.</i>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a TEMP directory on your hard drive. </li>
      <li>Copy the BIOS update file that you downloaded to this empty directory. </li>
      <li>Enter the following command at the DOS prompt: <br>
        CD\TEMP </li>
      <li>Enter the name of the file that you downloaded at the C:\TEMP&gt; prompt. When you enter
        this command you will extract the files contained within this compressed file. </li>
      <li>Enter &quot;EXTRACT&quot; or double click on the EXTRACT icon. You will see instructions
        to place a formatted 3.5&quot; floppy diskette in your A: drive. </li>
      <li>Follow the on-screen procedures to extract the flash BIOS update to the diskette in
        drive A:. </li>
      <li>Remove the new BIOS update diskette, reboot the computer, and enter System (CMOS) Setup.
      </li>
      <li>Insert the BIOS diskette in the A: drive, and then select the &quot;Update BIOS&quot;
        from the Advanced Options menu. </li>
      <li>Select &quot;Save changes, exit, and update BIOS.&quot; This option will reboot the
        computer and read the flash diskette in the A: drive. Following the beep codes, the BIOS
        will update and then the system should reboot, saving the changes. </li>
    </ol>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="9">How can I get more than 16 colors on my Premium II computer?</a></p>
    </b><p>The system board in the Premium II shipped with 256KB of video RAM. This amount of
    video RAM is not sufficient to display Super VGA images; it will not support more than
    16 colors. It is not possible to upgrade the amount of video RAM on the system board.</p>
    <p>However, it is possible to install a third-party, ISA-based display adapter to attain
    the higher resolutions and greater number of colors. When you install the new card, you
    should disable the integrated video chipset. To disable the video chipset, move SW1-1 in
    the bank of eight switches to the OFF position.</p>
    <p>If you have problems after you install the new card, the problem may be related to a
    conflict with the system's BIOS. Access System Setup by pressing <b>&lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt;</b>
    during a cold boot. In System Setup, press &lt;PageDown&gt; until you reach Setup Screen
    Two; then look for the option that reads &quot;Shadow BIOS.&quot; If it is set to
    &quot;Sys and Video,&quot; change it to read either &quot;Sys&quot; or &quot;None.&quot;
    You may need to try both settings.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="10">When I turn my system on there is no video and I hear two long beeps
    followed by three short beeps. What does this mean?</a></p>
    </b><p>The two long beeps followed by three short beeps often indicates that the CMOS is
    corrupted. Often this issue occurs with systems that have a flash BIOS. To resolve the
    issue, reflash the system&#146;s BIOS. If you require assistance with this procedure, or
    are uncertain which file to use, check the <a href="biostbls.htm">flash BIOS tables</a> or
    contact a <a href="suplines.htm">technical support representative</a> for assistance.</p>
    <b><hr>
    <p><a name="11">My system issues three short beeps followed by five long beeps (possibly
    another series of short beeps). What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>This beep code generally indicates bad or incompatible memory in the system. If you
    recently added memory to the system, try removing it. Does the problem go away? What
    happens if you install the additional memory only? Does the system function normally?</p>
    <p>Check your system&#146;s memory specifications. Do you have the correct memory
    installed? Does your system use tin-lead or gold-lead RAM? It is typically not a good idea
    to mix gold-lead and tin-lead SIMMs (DIMMs). When you mix two different conductors
    together in the same computer you can cause galvanization to areas on the system board.</p>
    <p>Also, check your system&#146;s memory configuration tables. You can usually find this

    following procedure to resolve this issue: <ol>
      <li>Open the Device Manager, expand the Hard Drive Controllers entry, and remove all
        controllers from the list. </li>
      <li>Insert the diskette with MSHDC.INF in the floppy drive.</li>

    <p>After you turn the system on, the new MSHDC.INF should correctly identify the
    controller. It may respond with a message that Windows 95 has detected new hardware and
    ask you to install a driver for it. Do not install the default driver; this is what you
    just removed. You need to inform Windows to install the driver from your floppy diskette,
    and then install the Intel 82371SB driver for the primary IDE controller. Reboot the
    system again; it should now detect the secondary controller and the CD-ROM drive. If
    Windows fails to recognize the drive, then you may need to repeat the procedure.</p>

    <p><a name="19">My AST desktop system does not recognize a second hard drive I added to
    the system. What is the problem?</a></p>
    </b><p>If the system has two IDE controllers (primary and secondary), you will need to
    determine the best configuration for your needs. Typically, the optimal drive performance
    configuration will have both hard drives installed on the primary controller and the
    CD-ROM drive (if present) on the secondary controller. </p>
    <p>Make sure that you configure the appropriate &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;
    jumper settings on both drives. If either drive is jumpered to be a Single, or both are
    jumped as Master (or Slave), the system will not correctly recognize the drives. Most hard
    drive manufacturers silk screen a jumper setting diagram or include a sticker on the drive
    that will help you set the appropriate jumper setting.</p>
    <p>Make sure the drives are properly identified in System Setup. Unless you have an older
    286 or 386 AST desktop system, you should set the hard disk to &quot;Auto.&quot; This
    setting will allow the BIOS to detect and configure most hard drives using Logical Block
    Addressing (LBA). <i>Note: LBA does not use the same drive parameters as ECHS (Enhanced
    Cylinders Heads and Sectors). The numbers of cylinders, sectors and heads in System Setup
    will not match the ECHS parameters recommended by the drive&#146;s manufacturer. That is
    not a problem; in fact, most drive manufacturers recommend using LBA if it is available.</i></p>
    <p>Another issue you may encounter is drive incompatabilities. A drive from one
    manufacturer may not function with a drive from another manufacturer when attached to the
    same IDE controller. Some drives will work with only one configuration. If you use hard
    drives from different drive manufacturers, contact the manufacturers and find out if there
    are any known issues between the two drives you own. Listed below are some links to some
    common drive manufacturers:</p>

    <p>Make sure that you cable the drives properly. You may want to keep an extra cable
    handy; often a faulty IDE cable can be mistaken for a bad hard drive. It is less expensive
    to purchase another IDE cable than it is to buy or replace a hard drive.</p>
    <p>Be aware of any operating system limitations. MS-DOS and early versions of Windows® 95
    use a FAT 16 file system. This file system will recognize up to a 2GB partition. If the
    drive you install is larger than 2GB, then you need to partition the drive accordingly.
    Depending on the file system (FAT or NTFS) that you use with the Windows NT&#153; Server
    and Windows NT&#153; Workstation operating systems, the size of the drive and partitions
    you can use will vary. For more information, check Article IDs: Q114841, Q119497, Q155615,
    Q153941 on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge
    Base</a>. For more information about FAT, HPFS, and NTFS, refer to article Q100108 on the <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/" target="_new">Microsoft Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
    <p>Do not forget to format the drive! The majority of most drive manufacturers require
    that you format the new drive when you first install it in the system. Often the drive
    will not be accessible, or you will see an error message stating &quot;The device is not
    functioning properly!&quot; until you format the drive. Be sure that you specify the
    correct drive letter or you may format the original drive that came with the system. </p>

    <p>Floppy drives are &quot;sensitive&quot; to their edge connector &quot;position&quot; on
    the grey floppy cable; in other words the floppy drive on the end of the cable is usually
    the &quot;A:\&quot; floppy drive and the drive on the secondary connector will be the

    systems that ship with an ATI mach64 video chipset, you need to change this address to
    A24. This change will eliminate any conflicts with the I/O addresses used by the video
    chipset.</p>

    seem to be recognized as 4MB SIMMs, why?</a></p>
    </b><p>At the time of manufacture, Bravo LC 486 systems were built to recognize
    single-sided memory. Since most 2MB, 8MB, and 32MB SIMMs are double-sided, the system may
    not recognize the upgrade.</p>

    <p><a name="26">In my Bravo MS/MS-T system, I am having problems installing an internal
    modem in Windows® 95. What do I need to do?</a></p>
    </b><p>Windows 95 will auto-add an integrated COM port even though the COM ports are
    disabled within System (CMOS) Setup. This feature will often cause problems when you
    attempt to add an internal modem on COM1 or COM2. </p>
    <p>To resolve this problem, disable one of the serial ports (preferably COM2) to free up
    the resources for the modem. Configure the modem to use COM2 and IRQ3. Next, disable COM2
    within the Windows Device Manager to eliminate any conflicts. These conflicts may occur
    because of Windows 95 Plug-and-Play capabilities. After the BIOS hands over the
    responsibility of the system's configuration to the Plug-and-Play operating system, the
    serial ports are detected again even when they are disabled in System Setup.</p>
    <p>Consider the following procedure to install the modem: <ol>
      <li>Disable COM2 in System Setup. To make this change, press the &lt;<b>Ctrl+Alt+Esc</b>&gt;
        key combination after a cold boot to access System Setup. Under the Ports option, set
        Serial Port 2 to Disabled. </li>
      <li>Start Windows 95 and then access the Device Manager.</li>
      <li>Select COM2 under Ports.</li>
      <li>Click on Properties.</li>
      <li>Remove the check from the box labeled &quot;Original Configuration.&quot;</li>
      <li>Click OK to return to Device Manager. Do not Remove COM2. It should have a red X next to
        it. Leave it just like this.</li>
      <li>Open Control Panel.</li>
      <li>Select Add New Hardware.</li>
      <li>Allow Windows to auto-detect new hardware. Windows should find the COM port.</li>
      <li>Select Add New Hardware again. This time, do not allow Windows to auto-detect new
        hardware. </li>
      <li>Choose your modem from the list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once Windows notifies the Registry that the modem has been added, you may need to
    reboot the computer to use the modem.</p>

    <p><strong><a name="28">What is AST's stance on Cupid upgradability?</a></strong> </p>
    <p><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p>
    <p>AST's proprietary 32-bit interface, CUPID architecture, links plug-in processor boards
    and memory expansion boards with the computer's system board. CUPID stands for Completely
    Universal Processor Input/Output Design. Several AST products, including the Premium and
    CUPID lines of desktop and tower computers, utilize CUPID architecture. </p>
    <p><b>BACKGROUND </b></p>
    <p>Most of the personal computers designed around the same time contained interdependent
    components, making upgradability virtually impossible. With the development of new,
    improved components, the user would have to replace the entire system in order to take
    advantage of new technology. </p>
    <p>AST designed CUPID architecture to allow customers to purchase the right level of
    computer performance for their current needs. In the future, the customer could increase
    processing power without having to endure the inconvenience of replacing the entire
    system. CUPID technology placed the components most likely to require upgrading on a
    removable processor board. Those components that typically remain constant resided on a
    separate system board. The user could upgrade the performance by simply replacing a
    plug-in processor board or adding SIMMs to a memory expansion board. </p>
    <p><b>CUPID TODAY </b></p>
    <p>AST introduced CUPID architecture well over six years ago, which is an extended period
    of time and technological advancement in the computer industry. In 1987, a 486 system was
    street priced at $10,000, so a $3,000 upgrade offered a viable alternative. Unfortunately,
    the cost of reproducing that technology remains the same, while the price of new
    technology is dropping drastically. These CUPID upgrade prices have not been well received
    by our customers. In the customer's own words, &quot;I could buy a whole new system for
    that price!&quot; </p>
    <p>AST realizes that the feasibility of upgrading to the higher performance processors
    with CUPID architecture is NOT competitive in today's marketplace. After thoroughly
    evaluating both AST and non-AST solutions to provide price competitive alternatives to
    CUPID upgrades, AST has decided not to invest additional engineering resources researching
    CUPID board redesign and third party compatible alternatives. In essence, AST will no
    longer offer CUPID processor and memory board upgrades. AST regrets the inconvenience that
    this decision may cause our users with CUPID systems.</td>
