    <p><a name="03"><b>How do I install a new application in the AST Works environment?</b></a>
    </p>
    <p>Although your AST Advantage! computer shipped with a wide variety of software, AST
    Works will grow as your needs and productivity increases. AST Works is compatible with

      <li>Click on <b>File</b> on the AST Works taskbar, and choose <b>Install...</b> from the
        pull-down menu. </li>
      <li>Enter the name of the installation utility. If you are unsure of what filename to enter,
        consult the application's documentation. Typically, most programs will use
        &quot;setup&quot; or &quot;install.&quot; You can also use the <b>Browse...</b> button to
        locate the file. </li>
      <li>Click on<b> OK</b> to register your selection. Follow any additional steps in the
        program's installation shield. </li>
    </ol>

    <p><a name="04"><b>How do I create a new icon in AST Works? </b></a></p>
    <p>As you add programs to your computer, you may want to update your AST Works desktop.
    Follow this procedure to create an icon in AST Works: <ol>
      <li>Click on the view button (e.g. My Software, Communications, Productivity etc...) where
        you want to create the icon. </li>
      <li>Click on View on the AST Works Taskbar, and choose Design from the pull-down menu. You
        can also start &quot;design mode&quot; by clicking on the T-square icon on the left side
        of the screen. The icon will appear as a U-turn arrow until you exit &quot;design
        mode.&quot; </li>
      <li>Click on the Add... button on the AST Works Taskbar, and then choose Program... from the
        pull-down menu. </li>
      <li>Fill in the appropriate &quot;Title:,&quot; &quot;Command Line:,&quot; and &quot;Working
        Directory:&quot; fields. You can use the Browse... button to search for these fields in
        your system. </li>
      <li>Use the &quot;Current Graphic&quot; to select the appropriate icon for the application. </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="05"><b>When I try to access the Communications view in AST Works, the
    Entertainment view pops up instead. Did I do something wrong? </b></a></p>
    <p>The Communications view may be corrupt. This problem often occurs when the Design
    button is not pressed after you create or move icons within AST Works. To resolve this
    problem, first run the SCANDISK and DEFRAG utilities from the DOS prompt to clean up any
    hard drive errors. </p>
    <p>Next, follow these steps to replace the corrupt files. You will need to have the AST
    Works Data Disc in the CD-ROM drive before you begin the procedure: <ol>
      <li>Exit all software including AST Works and Windows. </li>
      <li>Enter &quot;D:&quot; at the DOS prompt. </li>
      <li>Enter the following command at the D:\&gt; prompt:<br>
        CD\ORIGINALS\ASTWORKS\PICTURES\DESKTOP </li>
      <li>Enter the following command:<br>
        XCOPY COMM.DTP C:\ASTWORKS\PICTURES\DESKTOP </li>
      <li>Answer &lt;Y&gt; to overwrite the files. When you enter this command, your computer will
        copy the original Communications view from the AST Works Data Disc to the hard drive. Any
        icons that you have added will need to be re-created. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you need to reset one of the other views in AST Works, you can substitute one of the
    following files for COMM.DTP: <ul>
      <li>Main - MAIN.DTP </li>
      <li>Productivity - PROD.DTP </li>
      <li>System Tools - SYST.DTP </li>
      <li>Reference - REFE.DTP </li>
      <li>Entertainment - ENTE.DTP </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="06"><b>How do I restore the original Views in AST Works? </b></a></p>
    <p>If you ever need to restore the original views in AST Works, you can copy them from the
    AST Works CD. </p>
    <p>Follow this procedure to restore the original views in AST Works: <ol>
      <li>Exit AST Works and Windows. </li>
      <li>Insert your AST Works CD into the CD-ROM drive. </li>
      <li>Enter the following commands at the C:\&gt; prompt: <br>
        D:\<br>
        CD\ORIGINAL\ASTWORKS\PICTURES\DESKTOP </li>
      <li>Enter the following command: <br>
        XCOPY *.DTP C:\ASTWORKS\PICTURES\DESKTOP </li>
      <li>Enter &quot;CD..&quot; after the computer stops copying the files. </li>
      <li>Enter the following command: <br>
        XCOPY *.DB0 C:\ASTWORKS\PICTURES </li>
      <li>Enter &quot;C:&quot; after the computer completely copies the files. </li>
      <li>Enter &quot;WIN&quot; at the C:\&gt; prompt to return to Windows. </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="07"><b>How do I reset AST Works? </b></a></p>
    <p>After you run the AST Works desktop for a period of time, you may need to reset this
    shell application. Before you begin this procedure, we recommend that you run the SCANDISK
    and DEFRAG utilities to clear up any errors that may already exist on the hard drive. </p>
    <p>Before you reset AST Works, please note that any icons you may have created will need
    to be established again. Also, you will have to reconfigure Phone Center. Follow this
    procedure to reset AST Works: <ol>
      <li>Exit all software, including Windows. </li>
      <li>Insert the AST Works Data Disc into your CD-ROM drive. </li>
      <li>Enter the following command at the C:\&gt; prompt:<br>
        CD\ASTWORKS </li>
      <li>Enter the following command at the C:\ASTWORKS&gt; prompt:<br>
        ATTRIB -R *.* /S </li>
      <li>Enter the following command:<br>
        XCOPY D:\ORIGINAL\ASTWORKS C:\ASTWORKS /S </li>
      <li>Press &lt;A&gt; when you see the message, &quot;Overwrite (yes, no, all).&quot; </li>
      <li>Enter the following commands when the system finishes copying the files:<br>
        CD\<br>
        WIN </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This procedure should take about 15 minutes. </p>
    <hr>
    <p><a name="08"><b>When I use the speakerphone, I can hear the person calling in, but they
    cannot hear me. What's the problem? </b></a></p>
    <p>The most common cause of this problem is a wiring error. Make sure that the wires are
    plugged in properly on the back of the system. Double-check the following items: <ul>
      <li>The phone line from the wall should plug into the Line slot on the back of the modem. </li>
      <li>The microphone should plug into the Mic-in slot on the back of the modem </li>
      <li>The cable that connects location J5 on the modem should connect to location JP15 on the
        sound card. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure to answer the phone with the speaker phone software before Phone Center
    answers the line. If you wait until Phone Center answers the line, then disable Phone
    Center and answer with the speakerphone. Additionally, once you &quot;turn on&quot; the
    speakerphone, be sure to check the volume settings in the Creative Mixer. </td>
