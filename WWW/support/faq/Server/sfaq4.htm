<p><a name="3"><b>How do I install DOS and Windows SCSI drivers for the Manhattan P, V,
and G?</b></a> </p>

<p>The Manhattan P, V, and G systems include an integrated NCR SCSI interface. </p>

<p>For the Manhattan G systems and Manhattan P, V systems with BIOS version 1.13 or older,
load the following NCR drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file on the root directory of the boot
drive, in the following order:</p>

<p>DOSCAM.SYS: The basic SCSI driver for DOS and Windows.<br>
SCSIDISK.SYS: Supports SCSI drives that do not have 512-byte sectors, as well as SCSI
devices with removable media, such as SCSI floptical devices and cartridge hard drives.<br>
CDROM.SYS: Supports SCSI CD-ROM drives.<br>
ASPICAM.SYS: Supports ASPI applications, such as CorelSCSI! and Central Point Tape Backup.</p>

<p>These drivers are contained in the DOS subdirectory of the NCR PCI SCSI <br>
device drivers diskette (p/n 911283-313). If you do not have the NCR driver diskette,
download the following file from our Web site: </p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.ast.com/S-OTHER/283313.EXE">283313.EXE Manhattan P/V/G NCR SCSI
Drivers V.1.06 </a><br>
<br>
<b>Installing DOSCAM.SYS:</b></p>

<p>To install DOSCAM.SYS, use a text editor to add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS
file in the root directory of the boot drive: </p>

<p>DEVICE=C:\SCSI\DOSCAM.SYS /option </p>

<p>/option is one or more of the following options: </p>

<p><i>/RAMCOPY: Causes the driver to load the SCSI memory into system memory. This
increases the performance of the SCSI memory, but uses more system memory. </i></p>

<p><i>/T=n: Specifies the length of time, in seconds, that DOSCAM.SYS waits after sending
a command to a SCSI device. When DOSCAM.SYS issues a command to a SCSI device, a timer is
started. If the timer expires before the device sends a response back to DOSCAM.SYS,
DOSCAM.SYS assumes that something has gone wrong with the device. DOSCAM.SYS then tries to
re-establish contact with the device. By default, DOSCAM.SYS does not use this feature,
which is called a time-out. If you want to set a time-out period, use the &#147;/T=n&#148;
option, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of seconds you want DOSCAM.SYS to wait for the
time-out. </i></p>

<p><i>/ASK: Prompts you to indicate, each time the system starts, whether to load
DOSCAM.SYS. This option is useful if you want to use the system without being able to
access any SCSI devices. </i></p>

<p><b>Installing SCSIDISK.SYS:</b></p>

<p>You can use a text editor to install SCSIDISK.SYS. On the root directory of the boot
drive, add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS file immediately after the line that
contains the DOSCAM.SYS driver: </p>

<p>DEVICE=C:\SCSI\SCSIDISK.SYS /option </p>

<p>/option is one or more of the following options: </p>

<p><i>/ASK: Prompts you to indicate, each time the system starts, whether to load
SCSIDISK.SYS. This option is useful if you want to use the system without being able to
access any SCSI devices that use SCSIDISK.SYS. </i></p>

<p><i>/UNITS=n: SCSIDISK supports SCSI devices with removable media, such as floptical
drives and cartridge hard drives. The /UNITS=n option reserves partitions for these
devices by setting the number of logical drive units that are reported to the operating
system. The maximum value for &quot;n&quot; is 8. The /UNITS=n switch is useful when the
system is started without a cartridge or disk in the drive, or when the cartridge or disk
that has more than one volume partition is inserted after the system is started. In
addition, the /UNITS=n option enables you to remove a disk or cartidge and replace it with
another drive or cartidge that is partitioned into a different number of volumes, without
having to restart the system. Without the /UNITS=n option, you can start the system with a
removable disk or cartidge in the device, but you cannot remove it until the system is
turned off. A system with the SCSIDISK device driver installed allow you to boot the
system with a removable disk or cartridge; however, you cannot remove the disk or cartidge
until after you shutdown the system. If you want to remove the disk or cartridge without
shutting down the system, then you need to start the system without a disk or cartridge in
the drive. </i></p>

<p><i>/PROTECT=x: Enables you to write-protect a DOS volume on a SCSI hard drive.
&quot;x&quot; is the DOS volume, such as C or D. If you attempt to write to the volume,
you will receive a write-protected media error code. It is possible to bypass the
write-protection with a low-level program, such as FDISK. </i></p>

<p><b>Installing CDROM.SYS:</b></p>

<p>You can use a text editor to install CDROM.SYS. On the root directory of the boot
drive, add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS file immediately after the line that
contains the SCSIDISK.SYS driver:</p>

<p>DEVICE=C:\SCSI\CDROM.SYS /x:name /ASK </p>

<p>&#147;x:name&#148; is the name you want to assign to your CD-ROM, not a drive letter
designation. You must include a name, which can be any combination of up to eight
characters. </p>

<p><i>/ASK: Prompts you to indicate, each time the system starts, whether to load
CDROM.SYS. The /ASK switch is useful if you want to use the system without being able to
access the CD-ROM drive. To ensure that enough drive letters are available to identify all
devices connected to the SCSI adapter, add the MS-DOS LASTDRIVE command to the CONFIG.SYS
file: </i></p>

<p><b>LASTDRIVE=x </b></p>

<p>x is a drive letter in the range C - Z. The letter assigned to LASTDRIVE represents the
last logical drive DOS is able to recognize, and also represents the maximum number of
logical drives available. For example, LASTDRIVE=K enables you to access up to 11 logical
drives. For more information about LASTDRIVE command, see your DOS documentation. </p>

<p>Unless the documentation for your CD-ROM software specifies otherwise, use a text
editor to add the MSCDEX.EXE command from Microsoft to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the root
directory of your boot drive: </p>

<p><b>MSCDEX /D:name</b> </p>

<p>name=name of CD-ROM drive. Name must match name give in CONFIG.SYS file entry for
CDROM.SYS.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Installing ASPICAM.SYS:</b> </p>

<p>You can use a text editor to install ASPICAM.SYS. On the root directory of the boot
drive, add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS file after the line that contains the
DOSCAM.SYS driver and after any other lines containing SCSI drivers: </p>

<p>DEVICE=C:\SCSI\ASPICAM.SYS </p>

<p>For Manhattan P and V systems with BIOS version 1.14 and later, obtain the new NCR SCSI
drivers from Symbios Logic for the 4.0 SDMS PCI SCSI chipset. If you do not use the
updated drivers for BIOS version 1.14, then you may corrupt or lose of data.</p>

<p>You can obtain the drivers from Symbios Logic:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="ftp://www.symbios.com/pub/symchips/scsi/drivers"
target="target"><img border="0" src="../../images/Symbios.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Load the following NCR drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file on the root directory of the boot
drive, in the following order:</p>

<p>ASPI8XX.SYS: The basic SCSI driver for DOS and Windows.<br>
SYMDISK.SYS: Supports SCSI drives that do not have 512-byte sectors, as well as SCSI
devices with removable media, such as SCSI floptical devices and cartridge hard drives.<br>
SYMCD.SYS: Supports SCSI CD-ROM drives.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on installing the Symbios Logic SCSI drivers, view the
DOS.TXT file included with the drivers.</p>

<p><i>Note: To ensure that enough drive letters are available to identify all devices
connected to the SCSI adapter, add the MS-DOS LASTDRIVE command to the CONFIG.SYS file: </i></p>

<p><i>LASTDRIVE=x </i></p>

<p><i>x is a drive letter in the range C - Z. The letter assigned to LASTDRIVE represents
the last logical drive DOS is able to recognize, and also represents the maximum number of
logical drives available. For example, LASTDRIVE=K enables you to access up to 11 logical
drives. For more information about LASTDRIVE command, see your DOS documentation. </i></p>

otherwise, use a text editor to add the MSCDEX.EXE command from Microsoft to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the root directory of your boot drive: </i></p>

<p><i>MSCDEX /D:name </i></p>

<p><i>name=name of CD-ROM drive. Name must match name give in CONFIG.SYS file entry for
SYMCD.SYS.</i></p>

<p>All other servers manufactured by AST will require a manual year 2000 rollover. On
January 1, 2000, DOS and Windows customers can: 

<ul>
  <li>Change the date via the DATE command at the MS-DOS prompt.<br>
    or</li>
  <li>Change the date via the DATE icon in the Windows Control Panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The century byte in CMOS will be updated and the correct date will be kept through the
year 2099. This update has been verified with DOS 6.2, Windows® 3.1, Windows® 95,
Windows NT&#153; 3.51, and Windows NT&#153; 4.0.Customers that use OS/2 Warp will find
that the system automatically adjusts for the year 2000.</p>

<p><a name="16">I downloaded a BIOS update; how do I use it?</a> </p>
</b>

<p>Before you install a BIOS update, you should always make sure you downloaded the
appropriate file. Always consult BIOS.TXT for the latest BIOS update. If you are unsure
about a BIOS update, then contact a technical support representative for more information.
Listed below is the procedure you should follow once you download the BIOS update: 

<ol>
  <li>Create a TEMP directory on your hard drive. </li>
  <li>Copy the BIOS update file that you downloaded to this empty directory. </li>
  <li>Enter the following command at the DOS prompt: <br>
    CD\TEMP </li>
  <li>Enter the name of the file that you downloaded at the C:\TEMP&gt; prompt. When you enter
    this command you will extract the files contained within this compressed file. </li>
  <li>Insert a formatted 3.5&quot; floppy diskette in your A: drive and enter the following
    command at the DOS prompt:<br>
    EXTRACT<br>
    Entering this command will create the actual Flash BIOS update diskette.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider the following procedures for completing the flash BIOS update on the Manhattan
G, Premium SE, and Premmia SE systems: 

<ol>
  <li>Reboot the computer, and enter System (CMOS) Setup. </li>
  <li>Insert the BIOS diskette in the A: drive, and then select the &quot;Update BIOS&quot;
    option from the Main menu.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Save changes, exit, and update BIOS.&quot; Then, follow the on-screen
    instructions for completing the BIOS update. If the BIOS update succeeds, the computer
    will beep twice. After the beeps, you can remove the floppy disk and reboot the computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>When updating the BIOS on all other Manhattan Systems, view the README.TXT file for
BIOS update information.</p>
