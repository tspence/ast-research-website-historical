        <p><b><font><a name="1">Why is the Year 2000 an issue for PC operation?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>The original IBM AT Personal Computer, developed in the mid 1980s, was the blueprint for 
	today's PC designs. This design included a "Century Byte" which indicates the current century. The problem is 
	that the way in which the Century Byte is changed was never defined clearly. Consequently, the many PC designs that 
	have evolved from the AT may not all behave in the same way at the roll-over into the next century.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="2">How does this problem manifest itself?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><br>
        <font>The Century Byte is not rolled over automatically by the computer's hardware clock. The result is
	that after the millennium rollover the computer will store the year in its non-volatile memory as 1900 rather than 
	2000. Operating systems such as DOS and Windows 95 do not recognise dates prior to 4th January 1980 and will display 
	this date instead. If the computer's BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is not "Year 2000 compliant," this will cause 
	problems for software that requests the date from the computer hardware.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="3">What is "Year 2000 compliance?"</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>This term is in use to indicate the way in which computers should perform before, during, and 
	after the millennium rollover from 1999 to 2000.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="4">How is "Year 2000 compliance" measured?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>Several software packages exist to test personal computer hardware for year 2000 compliance.
	Unfortunately, these packages often measure different aspects of the computer's functionality, all of which may or 
	may not have a bearing on the computer's behavior during the roll-over period. Therefore, a computer that is 
	classed as 'Year 2000 Compliant' by one test may be failed by another. This situation has not helped the general 
	confusion surrounding the Year 2000 issue.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="5">What aspects of the computer's functionality are examined?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>All compliance-testing software should check the following:
<UL>
	<LI>Operating system date rollover from 23:59, December 31, 1999 to 00:01, January 1, 2000.</LI>
	<LI>Hardware clock date (obtained via the BIOS) rollover from 23:59, December 31, 1999 to 00:01, January 1, 2000.</LI>
	<LI>The computer's ability to recognize Year 2000 as a leap year.</LI>
</UL>
	<P>Additionally, some testing packages test for the following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Hardware clock date (obtained directly from the Real Time Clock) rollover from 23:59, December 31, 1999 to 00:01, 
	January 1, 2000.</LI>
	<LI>The computer's ability to recognize Year 2001 as NOT being a leap year.</LI></font>
</UL>
        <hr>

        <p><b><font><a name="6">My computer fails Y2K compliance testing package "X." What can I do?</a></font></b> </p>
        <p><font>Your PC may have the ability to correct the hardware clock when it boots up. Check the 
	"Actions Required" matrix in this document and locate your particular AST model. If there is a check mark in the box
	marked "Powered off rollover," then your PC will "correct" the problem on boot up. All you need to do is power the 
	machine off and back on again, any time after midnight January 1, 2000.</p></font>
	<p><font>If there is a check mark in the "Manual Update Required" box, you will need to type in the 
	correct date at the DOS prompt. This is a one-time operation which does not need to be repeated. Your AST PC will 
	correctly increment the date thereafter, including the ability to recognise the Year 2000 as a leap year.</font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="7">Will my computer be damaged or will all my data be lost?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>Your computer will not be damaged by an incorrect millennium rollover and you shouldn't 
	lose any existing data. However if you are "burning the midnight oil" on New Year's Eve around midnight inputting 
	date sensitive data, you could potentially have bad new data. This is dependent upon whether the program you 
	are using gets the current date from the operating system or from the BIOS.</font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="8">Can I still use my non-compliant PC in the year 2000 and beyond?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>Yes. Once your AST computer has been updated by either of the above operations, your hardware 
	will continue to operate correctly with respect to the date in the year 2000 and beyond.</font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="9">My computer is connected to a network. How will this affect me?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>If you are connected to a Novel or a Windows NT server, the time and date are automatically 
	downloaded from the server when you log on. Provided your file server is "Year 2000 compliant," your networked 
	computer will be updated correctly even if your networked computer itself is "non-compliant." </font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="10">How can I ensure my file server date is correct?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>If you have an AST file server then check the "Action Required" matrix in this document. 
	Most AST file servers manufactured since 1995 are "Year 2000 compliant" with the correct revision of BIOS.</font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="11">What about my software?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>You should be more concerned about your software than your hardware as there are no easy 
	fixes for software. There are software testing programs available but these will tend only to give information 
	regarding the major releases of commercial software that you may have installed on your machine. It is possible that there is a problem in 
	each individual spreadsheet because of the variety of ways in which you can format and calculate with the date.</font></p>

        <hr>
        <p><b><font><a name="12">Is there a magic bullet fix?</a></font></b></p>
        <p><font>For personal computer hardware, there are programs available that run in background and "fix" 
	the hardware year 2000 problem. However these programs do not run under all operating systems and have an associated 
	cost in terms of memory used and a financial cost.</font></p>
	<p><font>For software, there is no "magic bullet" and each package and its data files must be examined 
	individually for potential problems.</font></p>
