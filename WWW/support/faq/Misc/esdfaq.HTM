<p><a name="1">What is electrostatic discharge (ESD)?</b></font></a></p>

<p><font face="default">Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a fairly common occurrence.
Basically, you may notice electrostatic discharge when you walk across carpet, and then
touch a metal object. The shock that you feel is called electrostatic discharge. If the
discharge is lower than 3000 volts, then you will not feel the shock; however, the
discharge can still damage an electronic component.</font></p>

<p><font face="default"><b><a name="2">What causes ESD?</a></b></font></p>

<p><font face="default">Static electricity is an electrical charge at rest; it is usually
created by friction as stationary ions do not move in a current. Generally, a static
charge will accumulate on the surface of a non-grounded conductor, and on non-conductive
surfaces, such as plastic or clothing. One surface begins to accumulate negative-charged
electrons while the opposing surface will accumulate positive-charged electrons. When the
non-grounded conductor comes in contact with a grounded conductor, the charge is released.
Turn off the lights in a room, slide your feet across the carpet, and then touch another
person, occasionally, you may see the static electricity discharge from your finger. If
you can feel the charge then, you discharged at least 3,000 volts of static electricity.
If you could hear the discharge, then you discharged more than 6,000 volts. If you could
see the discharge, then you discharged more than 8,000 volts. There are several products
that generate ESD including polyethylene, vinyl, foam, polyurethane, synthetic textiles,
fiberglass, glass, and rubber.</font></p>

<p><font face="default"><b><a name="3">How does ESD affect my computer?</a></b></font></p>

<p><font face="default">Many customers decide they want to install new components in their
system. Whether these components are upgrades or new peripherals, the components and the
computer are very sensitive to ESD. Often ESD can damage the computer or component beyond
repair, so use caution when you work on your system. It does not take may volts to damage
an electronic component. A charge less than 3000 volts can damage most electronic
components.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="default"><b><a name="4">What type of damage can ESD do?</a></b></font></p>

<p><font face="default">ESD can cause two different types of damage to a system, upset
failures and catastrophic failures. A catastrophic failure indicates that the
electrostatic discharge damaged the component beyond repair. The component will not
function again. This type of damage is usually the easiest to detect. Most authorized
service centers can quickly detect this type of damage to a system or component. Although
ESD may have damaged an electronic component, the component may still function; this is
referred to as upset or latent failure. Although the component will still function, the
integrity of the component has been sacrificed. The component may not perform properly, or
the life of the component may diminish. This type of damage is difficult to detect since
the component will still function; however, some service centers have the ability to
detect this type of damage.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="default"><b><a name="5">What components can ESD affect?</a></b></font></p>

<p><font face="default">ESD can affect most electronic components, including hard drives,
system boards, expansion cards, floppy drives, processors, cache, and most other
components that use electronic circuitry.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="default"><b><a name="6">How can I prevent ESD from damaging a computer or
computer component?</a></b></font> </p>

<p><br>
<font face="default"><b>Use caution!</b> Now that you know what ESD is, you can prevent
this type of damage by taking care before you alter your computer. You can touch a piece
of metal before you touch a computer component to release the built-up static, and prevent
the charge from damaging the system.</font></p>

<p><font face="default"><b>Consider a static-control product.</b> If you frequently handle
electronic components, you may want to consider purchasing some preventative equipment.</font></p>

    straps come in the form of a wrist strap that you can wear around your wrist. The other
    end of the strap should be attached to a grounded piece of metal, such as a rail on the
    computer. Most computer stores sell these straps.</font></td>

    sell rubber floor and table mats that you can use to prevent static discharge. Although
    these mats can prevent static discharge from damaging the component, if you pick up the
    component, then it is susceptible to ESD damage.</font><p>&nbsp;</td>

<p><font face="default"><b>Keep your workspace clear.</b> Clear any excess materials in
the work area. Most manufacturers market their components in a box encased in cellophane;
remove the cellophane from the work space once you unwrap the new component. Since most
plastics are exceptionally conductive, keep them clear from the workspace.</font></p>

<p><font face="default"><b>Use caution when you handle an electronic component.</b> Hold
the component by the edges. Do not touch any of the soldered components on the board. If
you need to set the device down, then place it on the static-shielding bag. If you pass
the component to another person, the other person must be grounded, or you risk damaging
the component. Keep components away from your hair and clothing.</font></p>
