<p><b><font face="default">What is AST LifeLine?</font></b></p>

<p>AST-LifeLine automates the service process, making technical support easier to obtain.
By incorporating SystemSoft&#146;s TalkShop<font face="Symbol">ä</font> software and
VoiceView<font face="Symbol">ä</font> modem technology into your AST Advantage! system,
AST is providing a whole new way for you to obtain support. SystemSoft&#146;s TalkShop is
powerful software that takes advantage of your modem's VoiceView® feature.
SystemSoft&#146;s new technology lets you talk and exchange computer information during an
ordinary telephone call by automatically muting voice transmission momentarily while data
is transferred. With VoiceView TalkShop, a phone, and your computer, you can get
information in a whole new way. You can give someone your electronic business card, send
and receive files quickly and easily, or play games with someone at another location. And
since VoiceView TalkShop works over a single line phone connection, any transactions you
make are fast and secure. </font></p>

<p>What is SystemWizard?</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="default">SystemWizard is a Windows 95 software product that shipped on the
latest series of Advantage!® computers. SystemWizard automatically detects, diagnoses,
and resolves hardware and software problems. When you encounter a problem, the
SystemWizard Client will attempt to identify the problem and fix it. If SystemWizard
Client is unable to resolve a problem because it doesn't have enough information, the
application will attempt to connect with a phone line to a remote SystemWizard Server. If
the SystemWizard client is still unable to identify a solution, you will be instructed to
contact technical support.</font></p>

<p><font face="default"><b>How do I use SystemWizard?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="default">SystemWizard attempts to diagnose any type of PC problem. When you
experience a problem, follow these steps:</font> 

<ol>
  <li>Double click on the SystemWizard icon located on the desktop. The SystemWizard desktop
    will display a graphical representation of potential problem areas, such as hardware,
    software, printer, modem, monitor, etc.</li>
  <li>Select a problem area from the SystemWizard desktop where you think the problem is
    occurring. It is not critical for you to select the correct problem area. SystemWizard can
    still make the correct diagnosis even if the problem area you select is not where the
    problem exists.</li>
  <li>Select an answer from the list of symptoms. Based on your answers, SystemWizard will
    gather system-level data that is helpful in diagnosing and solving the problem. You may be
    asked additional questions before SystemWizard makes a diagnosis.</li>
</ol>

<p><font face="default">If SystemWizard cannot find the problem, the application will ask
if you want to attach to an AST SystemWizard Server. If you choose &quot;Yes&quot; the
SystemWizard will use the dial-up networking features on your system to connect to the
server. If SystemWizard still cannot solve your problem after it connects with the remote
server and updates its local information, you should contact your Technical Support
representative for the product(s) that you believe contain the problem.</font></p>
