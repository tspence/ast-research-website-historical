<p><a name="01"><b>What is a computer virus?</b></a> </p>

<p>A computer virus is code written to spread and infect files on a computer without the
user&#146;s knowledge. The main purpose of a virus is to spread and infect other files and
computers. A virus will not necessarily inflict damage to the system; however, there is no
such thing as a &#147;harmless virus.&#148; Although viruses are generally written to be a
prank, they can contain code that can violate the integrity of the system&#146;s data and
performance. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="02"><b>How many viruses are there?</b></a> </p>

<p>Since any person with good programming skills can write a virus, there is no way to
know the exact number of viruses in the wild. The WildList is a compiled list of viruses
that have been identified &#147;in the wild.&#148; Developed and maintained by Joe Wells,
a consultant to IBM&#146;s T.J. Watson Research Center, the WildList only names those
viruses that have been positively identified in the wild. The list is updated on a monthly
basis. Click <a href="http:/www.av.ibm.com/InsideTheLab/Monitor/WildList/">here</a> to
visit the WildList. </p>

<p>At the time of publication, there were close to 230 common viruses identified on the
WildList. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="03"><b>What is a worm?</b></a> </p>

<p>Like a virus, a worm is a program or group of programs that is designed to inflict
damage to a computer network. Worms do not need to attach themselves to a program like a
typical virus; however, worms often start from a host system, and then disseminate through
the network to infect other workstations. Often, worms can work in segments to perform
different actions on different systems; however, the overall effect means the integrity of
the data has been lost. Perhaps the most famous worm incident occurred in 1988 when a
Cornell graduate student planted a worm as a network experiment. A bug within the program
allowed the worm to multiply across hundreds of network links. This worm reportedly cost
millions in man hour times for testing and repair of the systems it affected. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="04"><b>What is a trojan horse?</b></a> </p>

<p>A trojan horse is a segment of code written in a program that was not documented by the
original programmer. The code is generally used as a &#147;loophole&#148; to access and/or
corrupt information. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="05"><b>I have heard about computer viruses, but can they affect me? </b></a></p>

<p>Yes. Viruses infect thousands of systems every day, and can potentially cause a
significant amount of damage to every system they come in contact with. With the
tremendous growth of the World Wide Web, online services, and the amount of electronic
media available to people, the threat of contracting a virus on a computer has
dramatically increased. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage to a system.
According to the National Center for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles, close to 550
million dollars have been lost to computer crimes. As a computer user, viruses can
potentially affect your system; if you use a floppy disk, download a file, or even use a
CD-ROM. There is not a computer that is &#147;completely safe&#148; from a virus. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="06"><b>What are the different types of viruses?</b></a> </p>

<p>Since virus identification and disinfection constantly changes as new viruses are
written and evolve, there is not a standardized method to identify computer viruses. The
Symantec AntiVirus Research Center (SARC) has categorized viruses into three distinct
categories according to the way they infect a computer system: 

<ul>
  <li>Program - Executable program files such as .Com, .Exe, .Ovl, .Drv, .Sys, .Bin </li>
  <li>Boot - Boot Record, Master Boot, FAT and Partition Table </li>
  <li>Multipartite - Both program and boot infector </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="07"><b>What is a program virus?</b></a> </p>

<p>Most program viruses attach themselves to some kind of executable file, store itself in
memory, and then corrupt the data within the program. Eventually, the virus will spread to
other programs where it will corrupt the data within the program, and even change file
names. Some common program viruses are Jerusalem and Vienna. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="08"><b>What is a boot sector virus?</b></a> </p>

<p>On every disk, hard drive, floppy disk, CD-ROM, etc., there is a boot sector. When a
computer first uses a disk, it first reads the boot sector of the disk. A boot-sector
virus can attach itself to executable code on this segment of the disk, and then spread to
other systems or disks. Once a virus infects the boot sector, it can change the
information about the disk size, and even format the disk without the user&#146;s
permission. Some common boot sector viruses are Michaelangelo, Stoned, and Empire. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="09"><b>What is a multipartite virus?</b></a> </p>

<p>A multipartite virus will infect both the boot sector and program files. One common
multipartite virus is the <a href="GRAPHICS\TEQUILA.GIF">Tequila</a> virus. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="10"><b>What are some virus symptoms?</b></a> </p>

<p>Listed below are some of the common symptoms some AST customers have mentioned: </p>

<p>&#148;My system keeps losing the settings in the System (CMOS) Setup, and the battery
is new.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;The controllers for the CD-ROM and/or hard disk are no longer present in the
Windows Device Manager.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;I typed MEM at the DOS prompt, and my system showed less than 640KB of
conventional memory.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;The screen looks like it was melting.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;The size of my program keeps changing.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;I kept getting random error within Windows.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;My hard disk reformatted itself.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;My Word documents with the extension .DOC keep changing to .DOT.&#148; </p>

<p>&#147;The extension for a program&#146;s files keep changing.&#148; </p>

<p>&#148;It takes longer for my programs to load then it ever has before.&#148; </p>

<p>Although there are a number of other variables that can also cause these symptoms, if
your computer exhibits one of these symptoms, then you may want to obtain a virus scanner.
</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="11"><b>How can I keep my system safe from a virus?</b></a> </p>

<p>There are several steps you should take to keep a virus from infecting your system: 

<ul>
  <li>Obtain a good virus scanner.</li>
  <li>Write-protect all scanned floppy disks.</li>
  <li>Scan all floppy disks and downloaded files with a scanner before you use them on your
    computer.</li>
  <p>Use caution when you select a site to download from. </p>
  <li>Obtain updates for your system&#146;s virus scanner so it will identify new viruses.</li>
  <li>Create a write-protected, bootable system disk in case the system is ever infected. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="12"><b>My computer has a virus; what should I do?</b></a> 

<ol>
  <li>Insert a bootable system disk in the floppy drive.</li>
  <li>Turn on the computer.</li>
  <li>Press the appropriate keystrokes to access the System (CMOS) Setup. These keystrokes are
    displayed when you first turn on the computer; they often are &lt;Ctrl+Alt+Esc&gt;,
    &lt;Delete&gt;, or &lt;F1&gt;.</li>
  <li>Access the Floppy and Boot section. </li>
  <li>Make sure you select, &#147;Try Floppy First.&#148;</li>
  <li>Save the changes to the System (CMOS), and then exit.</li>
  <li>Continue to boot from the bootable system disk.</li>
  <li>Scan the system with the virus scanner.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that several new scanners can scan within an infected system. Make sure you
follow any procedure from the manufacturer of the virus scanner. Additionally, do not try
to delete files to try and delete the virus yourself; you will probably do more damage to
your system by taking this form of action. </p>
