        <td>IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 3, 1996 -- Recognizing that the
        turn of the century poses significant challenges for the
        information technology industry, AST Computer
        (NASDAQ:ASTA) today announced that its line of commercial
        desktops, servers and notebooks are equipped to deal with
        the onset of the year 2000. All Bravo commercial desktops
        introduced after April 1996, Manhattan S6200 and
        Manhattan CommercePRO servers introduced after July 1996,
        and notebook PCs introduced after May 1, 1996 are next
        century-compliant.<p>&quot;We believe that a large
        percentage of businesses today are taking a 'wait and
        see' attitude and have not yet begun to address the
        technological issues of what a move to the next century
        really means,&quot; said Dan Sheppard, vice president,
        worldwide product marketing. &quot;The year 2000 is real
        and we are committed to providing technology solutions
        that address the challenges users face as they move into
        the next millennium.&quot;</p>
        <p><b><u>Moving Into the Next Century</u></b></p>
        <p>&quot;In the 1960&#146;s and 70&#146;s computers were
        living-room size, however, they had very little storage
        space. Rather than waste valuable and costly space,
        engineers programmed the computers not to store the first
        two digits of the year,&quot; said Sheppard. &quot;This
        means that when the next millennium arrives, the internal
        clocks of mainframes and other computing devices will
        change from 12/31/99 to 1/1/00, meaning that systems will
        not be able to distinguish between the year 1900 and 2000
        -- potentially throwing systems into chaos.&quot;</p>
        <p>AST however, has designed its current PC lineup to
        handle the year 2000 smoothly and efficiently. AST is
        actively replacing two-digit date fields, which cannot
        distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000, with
        four-digit fields by incorporating a four-digit year date
        code into the BIOS of its systems.</p>
        <p>AST recognizes that at risk for the year 2000 are
        proprietary applications, in which developers created
        their own date-related code instead of using the year
        2000 compliant date set supplied by vendors.</p>
        <p>&quot;Imagine that your insurance policy is up for
        renewal in the year 2001,&quot; noted Sheppard. &quot;If
        there is an error in the program due to a spreadsheet
        macro unable to issue a forecast beyond 2000, then a
        faulty program might recognize the last two digits of the
        year as 1901 and throw the policy out.&quot;</p>
