<p>What is so new about the Windows® 95 operating system?</b></a> </p>

<p>Windows® 95 is different from DOS operating systems that shipped on older AST
Advantage! computers, in that, it controls your hardware and software within the graphical
user interface with protected-mode drivers. These protected-mode drivers are different
than drivers found in a DOS operating system, in that, protected-mode drivers load within
the graphical user interface (GUI). This feature is unlike DOS that uses a CONFIG.SYS and
an AUTOEXEC.BAT to load the real-mode drivers for your system's peripherals. </p>

<p>In older Advantage! systems, you could control Windows through the SYSTEM.INI and the
WIN.INI. Within Windows® 95, there are several user interfaces you can use to control not
only Windows, but the peripherals for your computer. </p>

<p>In Windows® 95, the Registry is a unified storage repository for application and data
configurations. The Registry holds protected-mode driver information and Plug-and-Play
information for your system's components and applications. If you purchased an
off-the-shelf version of Windows® 95 as an upgrade for Windows 3.1, then Windows 95 used
INI files, such as the WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI, to build the Registry. Your system will
still have the older CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load real-mode drivers; however,
these files are not essential to run your Windows® 95 operating system. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="02"><b>Can I edit my Registry to make changes for Windows® 95?</b></a> </p>

<p>Every version of Windows® 95 includes a Registry editor. This editor can be used to
change the functionality of Windows 95 and other Windows related applications. Although it
is possible to use the Registry editor to repair a problem with Windows® 95, using the
Registry editor is extremely complicated, and not recommended for most AST customers.
Neither AST or Microsoft support editing the Registry. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="03"><b>What is the Device Manager?</b></a> </p>

<p>Within Windows® 95, you can control your hardware and peripherals through the Device
Manager. To access the Device Manager, right-click on the <b>My Computer</b> icon, and
then choose <b>Properties</b> from the pull-down menu. Now, click on the <b>Device Manager</b>
tab. You can also access the Device Manager through the Windows 95 Control Panel. Click on
the <b>System</b> icon, and then click on the <b>Device Manager</b> tab. </p>

<p>Once you access the Device Manager, you can view and control the properties for your
system's devices. Click to highlight the device from the list of hardware, and then click
on the Properties button. You can control the driver, Direct Memory Address (DMA), and
Input/Output (I/O) address for most of your computers hardware. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="04"><b>How do I change the display features for my computer in Windows 95? </b></a></p>

<p>Often, you may find it essential to change the display settings for your computer. To
access the Windows® 95 Display settings, right click on an empty area on the Windows® 95
Desktop, and then choose <b>Properties</b> from the menu. Now, you can click on the <b>Background</b>,
<b>Screen Saver</b>, <b>Appearance</b>, and <b>Settings</b> tabs to control the settings
your computer's display features. To change the settings for the color palette, desktop
area, and/or the font size, click on the <b>Settings</b> tab. You can use the slide bar
and the pull-down menus to make the adjustments to fit your needs. You can also change the
driver for your system's display adapter, or choose the appropriate monitor selection for
your computer by clicking on the <b>Change Display Type...</b> button. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="05"><b>What is the Windows® Explorer?</b></a> </p>

<p>Within Windows® 95, you can use the Explorer to control the files and folders in your
computer. The Windows Explorer is similar to the Program Manager found in Windows 3.x. To
access the Explorer, click on the <b>Start</b> button, and then choose <b>Programs</b>
from the menu. Now choose <b>Windows Explorer</b> from the expanded menu. </p>

<p>Through the Windows Explorer, you can drag and drop files and applications. Through the
various selections on the taskbar (<b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Tools</b>, <b>View</b>, <b>Help</b>),
you can control applications, map drives, and even get additional help on using Windows®
95. Although you can move and remove programs through the Windows Explorer, we recommend
that you use caution before you make any changes to the system. Windows uses file sharing
for many of its applications. If you delete or move a file that is shared with another
application, then you run the risk of damaging the other application. </p>

<p><a name="06"><b>How do I install a printer in Windows® 95?</b></a> </p>
