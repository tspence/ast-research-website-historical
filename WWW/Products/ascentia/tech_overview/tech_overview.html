<P><A NAME="pentium"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B>Ascentia Technology Overview</B></I></FONT></P>
<P><B>200 MHZ &amp; 233 MHZ INTEL&amp;REG; PENTIUM&amp;REG;<BR>
&nbsp;CPUs WITH MMX TECHNOLOGY</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="MMX"></A>MMX is abbreviated from multimedia extensions. Basically, it is an Intel Pentium processor
incorporating 57 new instructions that manipulate and enhance audio, video, graphics and image processing. The
Ascentia M Series will be first to market with Intel's latest mobile CPUs, the 200 MHz and 233 MHz Intel Pentium
processors with MMX technology. Incorporating Intel's latest 0.25 micron process technology and VRT (voltage reduced
technology) these new CPUs will provide the mobile user with unbeatable system performance on a mobile platform.
According to early Intel benchmarking the new 200 MHz and 233 MHz Intel Pentium processors with MMX technology
should provide over 20% more system performance than the equivalent 166 MHz version with no detrimental effect
to system battery life. All Intel Pentium processors with MMX technology incorporate 32 KB on internal cache. On
the Ascentia M Series this is complimented with an additional 512 KB of secondary cache, contributing to improved
system performance by reducing average memory access time to recently used instructions and data.</P>
<P><A NAME="430TX"></A><B>&nbsp;INTEL 430TX PCI CHIPSET</B></P>
<P>The Ascentia M Series also features Intel's latest mobile PCI core logic chipset. The 430TX chipset has been
developed to enable mobile PCs to match the overall performance of their desktop counterparts as well as being
enable to deliver USB (Universal Serial Bus) support. This chipset is also optimized for an Intel Pentium CPU with
MMX technology, which will deftly bridge the gap between the multimedia performance of notebooks and desktops.
In addition, the 430TX has Dynamic Power Management Architecture for the ultimate power savings in mobile applications
and UltraDMA hard disk drive protocol for greater I/O throughput. This allows faster hard disk drive activity supported
on a 4 GB drive.</P>
<P><A NAME="xga"></A><B>LCDs &amp; Graphics 13.3&quot; XGA LCD</B></P>
<P>With our unique relationship to Samsung Electronics Corporation, a world market leader in the design and supply
of LCD panels, AST is able to bring to market the latest Super VGA and XGA TFT LCD technology. The Ascentia M Series
incorporates a range of color LCD panels to meet corporate customer demands whether for a value system or for the
latest and greatest technology. To accommodate the larger form factor of the 13.3&quot; LCD there is a slight incremental
addition to the length of a notebook PC. On the Ascentia M Series, this added space has been utilized by our system
designers to provide the user with a more generous palm rest and &quot;desktop equivalent&quot; keycap form factor.
This will make it more comfortable for the touch typist, as well as the everyday user.</P>
<P><A NAME="7556_grph"></A><B>GRAPHICS SUPPORT</B></P>
<P>The Ascentia M Series utilizes the outstanding performance of Cirrus Logic's latest 64-bit video accelerator,
the CL-GD7556. The CL-GD7556 is a low power 3.3V, GUI accelerated XGA/SVGA controller. With its MVA (Motion Video
Acceleration) features, the GD7556 leads the industry in multimedia video quality. Like its sister chip the GD7555,
the CL-GD7556 will provide true-color, full motion video playback via DCI 1.x and Microsoft&amp;REG; Windows&amp;REG;
95. DirectDraw/DirectVideo support and accelerates MPEG-1 for Truemotion, Cinepak and Indeo codecs. The Ascentia
M Series incorporates 2 MB of Video RAM, supporting maximum external resolutions of 1280 x 1024 x 256 colors.</P>
<P><A NAME="mpeg"></A><B>MPEG &amp; Zoomed Video</B></P>
<P>MPEG is an acronym of Motions Pictures Expert Group. As such MPEG does not define a particular technology, but
rather defines a `standard' MPEG-1, -2, etc. MPEG is a compression format for video which enables high quality
picture sequences to be stored on a hard drive. The more recent, and now more common version offers higher compression
rates than its predecessor, the result of which is that more images can be stored in less space. Zoomed Video is
effectively a way of bringing significant multimedia functionality to a notebook via a new interface on the PC
CardBus slots. Basically the Zoomed Video or ZV port redefines some of the pins in the PC Card interface. These
pins support the audio &amp; video data streams and act as a simple dedicated bus to the system's graphics and
audio controllers. A Zoomed Video card installed into one of the notebook's PC Card slots effectively performs
as an MPEG-1 decoder. Decompressed video data is delivered back to the system's graphics controller. Using the
ZV Port interface, the decompressed video stream is sent directly to the graphics controller and audio sound chip,
and then on to the display screen and system speakers.</P>

<P><B>USB, IrDA, CardBus &amp; Ultra-DMA<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="&nbsp;USB"></A></B><I>USB</I> or Universal Serial Bus is a completely new way of connecting peripherals
to a PC. Developed by Intel, the USB port provides users with much easier Plug-n-Play connectivity and functionality,
addresses some of the issues of peripheral compatibility, and ensures that the design of peripherals will be easier
and more cost effective. Ultimately replacing traditional I/O ports, a USB provides virtually unlimited PC expansion
with the ability to daisy-chain up to 127 devices without the need to reconfigure dip switches, software drivers
or IRQ settings. USB utilizes a standard connector which allows users to install/remove a peripheral without having
to open the PC. Better still, with Plug n' Play support the user can both add and remove peripherals without having
to reset or reboot the PC. USB has a much faster data throughput (12 Mbps) than standard I/Os. Expect future USB
development in digital peripherals and integrated PC/telephony.</P>

<P><A NAME="irda"></A><I>IrDA</I> is short for Infra-red Data Association, the committee responsible for defining
the standard governing the infrared port on a notebook PC. To date there has been two standards set, the initial
IrDA 1 &amp; subsequent IrDA 2 standard (commonly referred to as FIR or fast infrared). The latter, more commonly
found on today's PCs, supports data transfer rates of 4 Mbps, slower than the 10 Mbps of the more earlier Ethernet
links, but much faster than the 115 Kbps of the earlier IrDA-1 standard. Please note that Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 configurations of the Ascentia M Series do not have built in support for infrared.</P>

<P><A NAME="cardbus"></A>CardBus described in its simplest form is the 32-bit version of your regular PC Card (PCMCIA)
slots. It is a 32-bit architecture operating at 33 MHz as opposed to the previous 16-bit architecture operating
at 8 MHz. This is effectively 4X the speed with double the amount of bandwidth, thus offering the performance benefits
of the desktop PCI bus in the PC Card form factor. In the latter half on 1997 and most certainly in 1998, expect
to see more companies move to the performance benefits of fast Ethernet. To achieve this with PC Cards, they will
require notebooks supporting CardBus technology. For those who wish to remain in the 16-bit world CardBus is backwards
compatible.</P>
<P>Other advantages of CardBus include the following;</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Improved power consumption. CardBus draws 3.3v of power as opposed to PC card which draws 5v.
	<LI>Its bus mastering functionality relieves the CPU of much of the information processing requirements.
	<LI>It has much better memory access to help with multitasking applications.
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Ultra"></A>U-DMA Officially called Ultra DMA-33. This is a protocol developed by Quantum Corporation
and Intel to support burst mode transfer rates of 33.3 Mbps. This is twice as fast as the previous hard disk drive
standard for PCs, and is necessary to take advantage of new,&nbsp;faster Ultra ATA disk drives.<BR>
