			EDO (Extended Data Output) RAM</B>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>A RAM specification that does not use error checking and instead relies on the dependability of modern memory
			devices. Because error checking is not used. EDO memory provides faster access than most other memory types.

			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>RAM that retains data even when the computer is turned off. The BIOS resides in write-protected flash memory
			on EEPROM chips. The BIOS in flash memory can be changed with an electrical burst. Flash memory enables you to
			update the BIOS from a floppy disk or over a network.
