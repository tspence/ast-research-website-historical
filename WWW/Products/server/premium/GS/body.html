						<B>Workgroup Server Solutions<BR>
						</B>With its industry-standard platform, the AST Premium&reg; GS offers remarkable performance and reliability
						for any growing business or branch office. Whether you're building your first network or you're managing a workgroup
						in a Fortune 500 company, the Premium GS will provide you with an easy-to-use, flexible and scalable server solution
						- at a price that won't exceed your budget.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Complete Performance For Your Evolving Needs</B><BR>
						Thoroughly tested with a wide variety of peripherals, applications and operating systems, the Intel&reg; standard
						Premium GS is easily integrated into virtually any network environment. It's also easily replicated for corporate
						workgroup networking projects. This ability can greatly simplify your administrative time and costs. As performance
						requirements increase, an additional Intel Pentium&reg; II processor can be installed, making AST's outstanding
						entry-level server a fully-functional SMP (symmetrical multi-processing) solution.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The Industry's Best Service, Support, and Warranty Programs Make Productivity Easy</B><BR>
						AST&reg; fully understands how critical your server is to successfully running your business. Therefore, we stand
						behind all of our Premium servers with a standard three-year warranty that includes next-business-day, on-site
						response* and a dedicated, toll-free server &quot;hotline&quot; available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We also
						offer Guardian CareSM an optional, highly responsive support service that includes 4-hour, on-site response from
						one of our trained system engineers. Furthermore, AST has a host of customer lifecycle services tailored to meet
						the specific needs of your company - regardless of its size. These programs* range from aggressive leasing programs
						with technology refresh options to product trade-in and asset recovery services. By keeping your system running
						and backing you every step of the way, AST is not just providing high-performance technology, but we're also helping
						to grow your business.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Easy Scalability Ensures Unlimited Potential For Growth</B><BR>
						The Premium GS is an ideal platform for growing organizations. It provides plenty of options to meet a wide variety
						of requirements and adapt to your business needs. You can add a second Intel Pentium II processor, more memory,
						mass storage, and I/O to enhance the system's overall effectiveness.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Advanced Technologies Offer High Performance Now- And Beyond</B><BR>
						Because this mini-tower chassis is packed with the latest technologies, you can rest assured that it will give
						your business the room it needs to grow. To begin with, the Premium GS utilizes the Intel 440LX chipset to ensure
						the highest performance from its Intel Pentium II processor. The Premium GS also includes high-speed SDRAM memory.
						It's 20% faster than EDO RAM and is ideal for running the most demanding server applications. The Ultra/Wide SCSI
						drives offer a level of performance primarily found in servers at twice the price. Intel EtherExpress™ 10/100 Fast
						Ethernet is also included for outstanding performance. This feature-rich integration means that your network is
						maximizing productivity, while minimizing cost.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>System Monitoring Software Provides Security, Reliability and Peace of Mind</B><BR>
						In order to reduce risk and better manage mission-critical data, the Premium GS has server monitoring features
						built right into the system. These include a self-test for the processors and monitoring and logging of critical
						subsystems such as memory, fan rotation, system voltages, and drive arrays. In addition, the Premium GS includes
						Intel LANDesk Server Manager software to reduce support costs and increase system uptime by remotely monitoring,
						diagnosing and controlling the server. Intel LANDesk Server Manager will keep track of crucial information such
						as voltage, temperature, chassis intrusion, and ECC memory errors. AST knows that system downtime can negatively
						impact your success, so we're doing everything to ensure that your server - and your business - are always running.
