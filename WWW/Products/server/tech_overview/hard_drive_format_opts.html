<H3>HARD DRIVE FORMAT OPTIONS</H3>

<P>There are several formatting options available for hard disk storage
depending on the operating system used. This section provides a description
of the benefits and drawbacks of the options subdivided by operating system.
Examples of situations in which each option may be the most advantageous
are provided.</P>

<H4><A NAME="i_i_ethernet"></A>NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS</H4>

<P>The Premium HS includes an integrated intelligent Intel EtherExpress
PRO/100 Server Adapter in the basic configuration. However, large networks
and those with extensive traffic may require additional bandwidth to support
the load. This section describes some of the concerns which will influence
the decision to add networking capability through add-in network interface
cards (NICs).</P>

<P>If the system is running, check the performance monitors and determine
if the network is fully utilized. If network usage is up at or near 100%
most of the time, additional network capability may be required.</P>

<P>If the system is not yet running, you can assume that each network card
running at 10 Mb/s supports up to 16 users per hub on average. Increased
network usage reduces this number and applications that require little network
access increase this number. The 100 Mb/s ethernet will support proportionately
more users.</P>

<P>Simply adding NICs may not solve the network bottleneck. Other network
components may produce a more effective solution. A network analysis may
be necessary to determine your exact networking needs. The server can support
additional NICs to the capacity of its add-in board slots.</P>

<P>Note that some NICs do not work well in conjunction with others. Compatibility
issues between cards must be addressed on a card by card basis. AST tests
the cards offered by its Preferred Partners for compatibility with AST servers.
Compatibility between cards is the responsibility of the card manufacturers.
