			<P>AST<FONT SIZE="2">&reg;</FONT> has designed a new <I>FlexChassis</I> which allows easy access to the inside
			of your computer with just a push of a button! This tool-less entry chassis, is also the industry's first NIX design,
			allowing the motherboard to slide out of the chassis with the flip of a lever.</P>

			<P>AST's new innovative AST-<I>FlexChassis</I> design will dramatically reduce the time it takes to upgrade and
			service your computer, making system maintenance a snap. The six major components: hard drives, floppy drives,
			RAM, CPU, CD-ROM and Video RAM have been located to provide optimum accessibility.</P>

			<P>Upgrading and servicing your Bravo system has never been easier, there's even a no touch zone on the motherboard,
			allowing space for full length <A HREF="../../terms.html#pci">PCI</A> &amp; <A HREF="../../terms.html#isa">ISA</A>
			cards.<A NAME="Comparative_Decibel"></A></P>

			<P>Other enhancements provided by the AST-FlexChassis design are: improved thermal characteristics, more rear panel
			1/0 connectors, and support for tall memory modules.

			</I>System Noise Reduction (SNR)</B>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>In 1993, AST pioneered the energy-managed &quot;Green PC&quot; technology, bringing the first environmentally
			friendly PC to the world. Today, AST is breaking more new ground, by fighting the newest type of environmental
			concern - &quot;white noise&quot; pollution.<BR>
			<BR>
			AST first introduced this technology in Europe in 1996, based on the great response it received, AST's <I>System
			Noise Reduction</I> (SNR) technology is now being made available worldwide. As systems grow more powerful with
			higher and higher MHz ratings, the cooling requirements and accompanying noise levels rise proportionately.<BR>
			<BR>
			ASTs <I>SNR</I> technology addresses this cooling problem by incorporating a thermistor, which controls the variable-speed
			fan in the power supply. When the system temperature increases, the fan speed increases providing maximum cooling
			yet generating minimal noise. The noise level that the user perceives is also affected by fan and vent location,
			which have been designed for quiet operation coupled with maximum cooling.<FONT SIZE="2">**</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			Overall system noise on our Bravo MS desktops is reduced from 30.7dB to 27.8 dB - <I>a 71 % decrease!<BR>

			<P><B>Intel 430TX PCI Set and Max Technology</B></P>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>The Intel 430TX PCIset provides better system integration between components and the core logic, thereby providing
			system performance gains of up to 15% from previous core logic chipsets. This core logic also enables advanced
			technology such as <A HREF="../../terms.html#sdram">SDRAM</A>, ACPI, <A HREF="../../terms.html#Ultra" target="_self">UltraDMA-33</A>,
			and MMX technology.</P>

			<P>MMX technology uses high performance Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) technology and brings 57 new instructions
			to the processor that allow applications to achieve a new level of performance.</P>

			<P>MMX technology operates at 64-bits, Intel's general-purpose registers have only 32-bits, and is designed to
			enhance the performance of a variety of multimedia and communications applications. Software developers can use
			MMX technology to realize faster video frame rates, allowing for smoother, more realistic video.</P>

			<P>MMX technology will also make advanced applications such as video conferencing, previously requiring expensive
			hardware, a much more practical business solution for today's PC.

			<P><B>UltraDMA-33 With S.M.A.R.T Drive Technology</B>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>UltraDMA- 33 represents the latest evolution of IDE hard drive technology. The burst transfer rate doubled from
			16.7 MB/s to 33 MB/s bringing the effective transfer rate of the system's bus and a drive's internal data rate
			into balance.</P>

			<P>Cyclical Redundancy Checking (CRC) has also been added, providing an increase in data integrity. Self-Monitoring,
			Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T) monitors the hard drive activity to proactively indicate a potential
			failure. For example, if your hard drive's read/write errors increase dramatically during use, the S.M.A.R.T technology
			will alert a system administrator of a potential failure allowing IS departments to resolve problems before they
			even occur!</P>

			<P>System downtime, productivity loss, and even loss of valuable data can be prevented through the combined use
			of S.M.A.R.T drives and Intel LANDesk software.

			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>SDRAM provides the highest memory bandwidth available on the market today to support enhanced media-rich performance
			and reduced memory access time. Coupled with Intel's new 430TX core logic, it provides a 2% performance improvement
			over <A HREF="../../terms.html#edo">EDO</A> memory. In addition, the Bravo MS has been designed so users can mix
			and match EDO and <A HREF="../../terms.html#sdram">SDRAM</A> memory increasing flexibility.
