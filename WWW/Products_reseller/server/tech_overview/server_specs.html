<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The 3-channel RAID controller provides a wide array of options for RAID
support and control. This section describes the characteristics of the various
RAID levels and gives examples of cases in which a particular RAID level
may prove the most advantageous.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 0</H4>

<P>Level 0 RAID provides block striping across multiple drives, but provides
no data redundancy. Because the data is striped across all drives in the
array, any drive access of sufficient size will be read from all devices
simultaneously. Therefore the data will be retrieved much faster than if
it were all on the same drive. RAID 0 offers significant performance and
storage efficiency improvements over individual drives.</P>

<P>However, RAID 0 offers no data redundancy and therefore no protection
against loss of data. In fact, if a file is distributed across several devices,
the failure of any one drive in the array renders the file irretrievable.</P>

<P>RAID 0 should be used only in time or space critical applications where
data redundancy is not required and maximum performance is required. Any
situation where data integrity is an issue should not use RAID 0. Spindle
synchronized drives are helpful in RAID 0 environments.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 1</H4>

<P>Level 1 RAID is also called drive mirroring. Drives are paired and all
data is written to both drives in the pair simultaneously. RAID 1 offers
maximum security because a complete, up-to-the-minute hot backup is available
at all times. Mirroring is only susceptible to the loss of both drives in
a pair simultaneously. Writes to a RAID 1 must write to both drives, but
reads can access the drives independently. Therefore read time can be halved
using a RAID 1 array though write times remain unchanged.</P>

<P>Because RAID 1 offers no striping, there is little performance improvement
over using individual, independent drives. Each data read accesses only
the two drives of the pair and can only double read time, while leaving
write times unchanged.</P>

<P>RAID 1 is most useful in applications where the expense of purchasing
twice the number of drives is acceptable and performance in relation to
independent drives is not an issue. Applications that require extreme data
integrity benefit from the security of RAID 1. RAID 1 can provide the best
performance of any redundant array type in multi-user environments.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 3</H4>

<P>Level 3 RAID stripes data across groups of drives with one drive in the
array dedicated to storing parity information. Much like RAID 0, RAID 3
arrays provide increased read performance because records can be read from
all drives simultaneously. However, all writes must access both the data
drives and the parity drive, which prevents overlapping writes and inhibits
performance. Data security is provided by the drive containing the parity
data, which allows reconstruction of data stored on a failed drive.</P>

<P>RAID 3 is vulnerable to the loss of the parity drive in the array. Since
all parity information is kept on a single drive, the loss of this drive
results in an extended period of degraded performance while all records
on the remaining drives are read and the parity data is regenerated. RAID
3 also fails to provide peak performance in multi-user environments and
those with many small files.</P>

<P>RAID 3 functions best in environments where only one user is accessing
data at a time and the file sizes are large. Systems with a large number
of users or those with many small files will experience only a minor performance
increase over independent drives. Spindle synchronized drives are required
to prevent the loss of performance with small files. RAID 3 requires at
least three drives to complete the array.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 5</H4>

<P>Sometimes called a rotating parity array, RAID 5 uses record striping
and saves parity data like RAID 3. However, it stores the parity data on
each drive in turn so that no one drive is dedicated entirely to parity
storage. RAID 5 allows both reads and writes to be overlapped, increasing
performance. Since RAID 5 also provides parity data, redundancy is maintained
and data can be restored fairly quickly whichever drive fails.</P>

<P>RAID 5 has few weaknesses, however, it is also a compromise between the
more extreme RAID levels. RAID 0 offers superior performance and efficiency,
but does not provide the redundancy of RAID 5. RAID 1 offers superior redundancy
and therefore superior data integrity, but does not provide the ability
to overlap write commands. RAID 5 also provides superior storage efficiency
to RAID 1. RAID 5 can use a large number of drives and sacrifice space equivalent
to only one drive for parity data.</P>

<P>Because RAID 5 stores parity data for redundancy, that data must be updated
at every write. The necessity of regenerating parity data at every write
keeps RAID 5 performance below that of RAID 1 in most cases. Like RAID 3,
RAID 5 also requires a minimum of three drives to function.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 10</H4>

<P>RAID 10 is a combination of levels 1 and 0. RAID 10 pairs drives and
then stripes data across the pairs as if each pair was a single drive. This
combination provides great data redundancy and takes advantage of the performance
and efficiency of data striping.</P>

<P>However,RAID 10 suffers from the same high cost as RAID 1. Each disk
is mirrored providing 100% data redundancy, but requiring twice the number
of physical drives as a pure RAID 0. RAID 0 striping increases the overall
efficiency and performance of the array but does not necessarily equal a
smaller array or another level.</P>

<P>RAID 10 is best used in environments where data redundancy is critical,
but performance and efficiency cannot be entirely sacrificed.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 30</H4>

<P>RAID is a combination of levels 3 and 0. Redundant arrays, each with
a dedicated parity drive, are arrayed together and striped. RAID 30 makes
use of the parity information of the dedicated parity drive and lessens
the danger of losing that drive by striping the parity data across all of
the dedicated parity drives.</P>

<P>Multi-user environments that require multiple simultaneous reads and
writes do not do well under RAID 30. Small files are also a problem for
this RAID level and result in less spectacular performance.</P>

<P>RAID 30 is most useful in environments where non-interactive applications
process large files sequentially, requiring fault tolerance and high speed.
RAID 30 requires a minimum of 6 drives to complete the array.</P>

<H4>&nbsp;</H4>

<H4>RAID LEVEL 50</H4>

<P>RAID 50 combines levels 5 and 0. Rotating parity arrays are established
and then combined into a striped array, without additional parity data.
This scheme increases the performance and efficiency of the RAID 5, but
does nothing to improve the data redundancy.</P>

<P>RAID 50 requires at least 6 drives to function and provides only slight
improvements in performance over RAID 5. RAID 50 provided improvements in
performance and efficiency, while still providing fault tolerance.</P>

<P>RAID 50 is most useful in environments where performance, efficiency,
and security are of equal importance.
