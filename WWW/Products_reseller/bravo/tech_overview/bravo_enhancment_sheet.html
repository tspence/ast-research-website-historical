AST<FONT SIZE=-1>&REG;</FONT> has designed a new <I>FlexChassis</I> which
allows easy access to the inside of your computer with just a push of a
button! This toolless entry chassis, is also the industry's first NIX design,
allowing the motherboard to slide out of the chassis with the flip of a
lever.</P>

<P>AST's new innovative AST-<I>FlexChassis</I> design will dramatically
reduce the time it takes to upgrade and service your computer, making system
maintenance a snap. The six major components: hard drives, floppy drives,
RAM, CPU, CD-ROM and Video RAM have been located to provide optimum accessibility.</P>

<P>Upgrading and servicing your Bravo system has never been easier, there's
even a no touch zone on the motherboard, allowing space for full length
<A HREF="../../terms.html#pci" TARGET="_self">PCI</A> &amp; <A HREF="../../terms.html#isa"
TARGET="_self">ISA</A> cards.<A NAME="Comparative_Decibel"></A></P>

<P>Other enhancements provided by the AST-FlexChassis design are: improved
thermal characteristics, more rear panel 1/0 connectors, and support for
tall memory modules.</TD></TR>

In 1993, AST pioneered the energy-managed &quot;Green PC&quot; technology,
bringing the first environmentally friendly PC to the world. Today, AST
is breaking more new ground, by fighting the newest type of environmental
concern - &quot;white noise&quot; pollution.</P>

<P>AST first introduced this technology in Europe in 1996, based on the
great response it received, AST's <I>System Noise Reduction</I> (SNR) technology
is now being made available worldwide. As systems grow more powerful with
higher and higher MHz ratings, the cooling requirements and accompanying
noise levels rise proportionately.</P>

<P>ASTs <I>SNR</I> technology addresses this cooling problem by incorporating
a thermistor, which controls the variable-speed fan in the power supply.
When the system temperature increases, the fan speed increases providing
maximum cooling yet generating minimal noise. The noise level that the user
perceives is also affected by fan and vent location, which have been designed
for quiet operation coupled with maximum cooling. Hard disk drives also
contribute to the noise level in a system. For this, AST has incorporated
a specially designed sound-dampening enclosure to reduce the mechanical
noise emitted from the hard drives.<A NAME="430TX_Pci_set"></A></P>

<P>Overall system noise is reduced from 30.7dB to 27.8 dB - <I>a 71 % decrease!</I></TD></TR>

<P>The Intel 430TX PCIset provides better system integration between components
and the core logic, thereby providing system performance gains of up to
15% from previous core logic chipsets. This core logic also enables advanced
technology such as <A HREF="../../terms.html#sdram" TARGET="_self">SDRAM</A>,
ACPI, <A HREF="../../terms.html#Ultra" TARGET="_self">UltraDMA-33</A>, and
MMX technology.</P>

<P>MMX technology uses high performance Single Instruction, Multiple Data
(SIMD) technology and brings 57 new instructions to the processor that allow
applications to achieve a new level of performance.</P>

<P>MMX technology operates at 64-bits, Intel's general-purpose registers
have only 32-bits, and is designed to enhance the performance of a variety
of multimedia and communications applications. Software developers can use
MMX technology to realize faster video frame rates, allowing for smoother,
more realistic video.<A NAME="UltraDMA-33"></A></P>

<P>MMX technology will also make advanced applications such as video conferencing,
previously requiring expensive hardware, a much more practical business
solution for today's PC.</TD></TR>

<TD COLSPAN="3"><P><B><I>UltraDMA-33 With </I></B><A NAME="smart"></A><B><I>S.M.A.R.T Drive
Technology</I></B><BR>
UltraDMA- 33 represents the latest evolution of IDE hard drive technology.
The burst transfer rate doubled from 16.7 MB/s to 33 MB/s bringing the effective
transfer rate of the system's bus and a drive's internal data rate into
balance.</P>

<P>Cyclical Redundancy Checking (CRC) has also been added, providing an
increase in data integrity. Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T) monitors the hard drive activity to proactively indicate a potential
failure. For example, if your hard drive's read/write errors increase dramatically
during use, the S.M.A.R.T technology will alert a system administrator of
a potential failure allowing IS departments to resolve problems before they
even occur!<A NAME="SDRAM"></A></P>

<P>System downtime, productivity loss, and even loss of valuable data can
be prevented through the combined use of S.M.A.R.T drives and Intel LANDesk
software.</TD></TR>

<TD COLSPAN="3"><B><I>Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM)</I></B><BR>
SDRAM provides the highest memory bandwidth available on the market today
to support enhanced media-rich performance and reduced memory access time.
Coupled with Intel's new 430TX core logic, it provides a 2% performance
improvement over <A HREF="../../terms.html#edo" TARGET="_self">EDO</A> memory.
In addition, the Bravo MS has been designed so users can mix and match EDO
and <A HREF="../../terms.html#sdram" TARGET="_self">SDRAM</A> memory increasing
flexibility.</TD></TR>
