<H4><A NAME="pent_2"></A>Intel Pentium II Processor</H4>

<P>Standard on the Bravo MS is the Intel Pentium II processor. The Intel
Pentium II processor is for those who have little patience for delays. No
matter what you do on your business desktop, it can be done faster with
the Pentium II. The Pentium II processor builds upon its Pentium Pro predecessor
by incorporating 7.5 million transistors, 32KB of primary cache, 512KB of
secondary cache, and Intel's MMX technology to bring to you the best performance
available for 16-bit and 32-bit applications running on advanced operating
systems such as Microsoft's<FONT SIZE=-1>&REG;</FONT> Windows<FONT SIZE=-1>&REG;</FONT>
'95 and Window NT<FONT SIZE=-1>&REG;</FONT>. Software developers can use
the Pentium II with MMX to improve full-motion video, enhance colors, and
achieve smooth graphics. If you need the freedom to excel, the Intel<FONT
 SIZE=-1>&REG; </FONT>Pentium II is for you.<IMG SRC="images/440LX.gif"

<H4><A NAME="440lx_agp"></A>Intel 440LX AGPset</H4>

<P>With the Pentium II processor-based Bravo MS the business user get full
access to Intel's most feature rich core logic chipset, the Intel 440LX
AGPset. The 440LX brings a leap forward in functionality to the Bravo MS,
complementing the power of its Pentium II processor. Key technologies and
features enabled by the 440LX include <A HREF="#agp" TARGET="_top">Accelerated
Graphics Port </A>(AGP) technology, Quad Port Acceleration, <A HREF="../../terms.html#Ultra"
TARGET="_self">UltraDMA-33</A>, <A HREF="../../terms.html#sdram" TARGET=
"_self">SDRAM</A>, and ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).
The impact of these features on the performance of the Bravo MS are highlighted
below.</P>

<H4>440LX and Quad Port Acceleration</H4>

<P>With the 440LX comes three unique architectural optimizations called
Quad Port Acceleration (QPA) that increase overall system concurrency (bandwidth
and performance), elevating the computing experience. QPA includes Direct
Connect AGP, Dynamic Distributed Arbitration and Multistream Memory Access.</P>

<H4><A NAME="agp"></A>Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)</H4>

<P>Perhaps the most exciting technology brought forth by the Bravo MS 6000
series is AGP. The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) brings faster and better
graphics to the Bravo MS. The best performance will be seen in AGP optimized
applications, but non-AGP optimized applications will also benefit. AGP
uses a connector similar to the <A HREF="../../terms.html#pci" TARGET="_self">PCI</A>
bus, with 32-bits of multiplexed address and data. While the PCI bus, clocked
at 33 MHz, supports a maximum 132 MB/s transfer rate, an AGP point-to-point
connection operating at 66 MHz yields a surprising 528 MB/s peak transfer
rate. Although throughput may vary depending on application, it will usually
obtain about 50~80% of peak rate in real world sustainable transfers. Note
that AGP cards that support 133MHz transfer rates are also supported on
the Bravo MS.</P>

<P>A unique feature of AGP is that it can dynamically access unused main
system memory -- in addition to using its own dedicated memory. Fully-implemented
AGP Graphics chips can exploit main memory directly (know as DIME for DIrect
Memory Execute) for the complex operation of texture-mapping. Other key
benefits of AGP are increased graphics bandwidth (at least 4x), increased
overall system bandwidth (due to graphics I/O being removed from the PCI
bus), and the equivalent of an extra expansion slot.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ati_rage"></A>Integrated PCI 2D/3D Graphics -- ATI Rage II+</H4>

<P>For those satisfied with standard PCI graphics, the Bravo MS's integrated
ATI Rage II+ delivers superior 3D features and performance including perspective
correct texturing, Gouraud shading and a host of other special 3D effects.
Additionally, superior 2D acceleration is achieved through an advanced architecture
that is optimized for SGRAM. On the Bravo MS graphics memory can be expanded
to 6MB of SGRAM.</P>

<H4><A NAME="flexchassis"></A>AST NLX FlexChassis</H4>

<P>With the push of a button the AST's <A HREF="bravo_enhancment_sheet.html#flexchassis"
TARGET="_self">FlexChassis</A> allows easy access to the inside of your
computer. This tool-less entry chassis surrounds the AST NLX system board
which slides out of the chassis with a flip of a lever. The design of the
chassis allows for full-length PCI, <A HREF="../../terms.html#isa" TARGET=
"_self">ISA</A>, and AGP cards and easy access to any space on the system
board, especially important when upgrading system or graphics memory. This
tool-less chassis will dramatically reduce the time spent upgrading and
servicing your computer, making system maintenance an ease and lower the
total cost of ownership.</P>

<H4><A NAME="snr"></A>System Noise Reduction</H4>

<P>As systems have become more powerful and faster, system noise has become
more of an issue. AST's <A HREF="bravo_enhancment_sheet.html#snr" TARGET=
"_self">System Noise Reduction</A> (SNR) technology addresses a variety
of noise issues with a variety of solutions. Quieter, variable-speed fans
are used to cool systems. Sound dampening materials are used to encase hard
disk drives, reducing especially irritating high-pitched noises. And the
location of fans and vents are designed to produce the best combination
of noise reduction and cooling.</P>

<H4>SDRAM DIMMs</H4>

<P>Another feature enabled by the 440LX is SDRAM. SDRAM DIMMS offer the
fastest and most efficient system memory performance on the market. The
Bravo MS uses 120MHz SDRAM with a cycle time of 12 nanoseconds -- typical
EDO RAM has a cycle time of 60 nanoseconds. SDRAM is the first DRAM technology
designed to synchronize itself with the processor. SDRAM (either ECC or
non-ECC) is just another feature aimed at increasing the performance of
the Bravo MS.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ultra_smart"></A><A HREF="bravo_enhancment_sheet.html#smart"
TARGET="_self">UltraDMA33 with S.M.A.R.T. and CRC</A></H4>

<P>Yet another major feature enabled by the 440LX is UltraDMA-33 technology,
the latest in hard disk drive technology and standard on all Bravo MS systems.
The burst transfer rate of an Ultra DMA33 hard disk drive is 33 MB/s which
is more than double that of its predecessor, the PIO Mode 4 IDE hard disk
drive. An additional feature on Bravo MS hard disk drives is S.M.A.R.T.
(System Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) technology, an algorithm
that will send a signal if your hard disk drive exhibits signs of impending
failure. Also included is a feature call CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Checking)
which helps to maintain data integrity.</P>

<H4><A NAME="integrated_ethernet"></A>Integrated Intel 10/100 Ethernet</H4>

<P>Need to get connected to a network? Look no further. Integrated into
the Bravo MS system board is Intel's PCI based 10/100 MB Ethernet which
utilizes a 32-bit bus master architecture to provide the right balance of
high throughput and low CPU utilization for optimal efficiency. The integrate
Intel 10/100 Ethernet will automatically switch between 10MB Ethernet and
100MB Fast Ethernet depending on your network. Furthermore, the Wake-on-LAN
feature required by PC98 is supported.</P>

<H4>Integrated 16-Bit Audio</H4>

<P>For those presentations with sound, for sound clips off the internet,
or for reviewing multimedia presentations from a CD-ROM, the Bravo MS provides
its user with integrated rich Sound Blaster compatible 16-bit audio with
3D effect and a high quality FM synthesizer. Through the use of multi-channel
virtualization, a 6-speaker (Dolby AC-3) can be recreated using just two
computer speakers, bringing a new world of sound effects into any business
presentation. The 3D solution produces an incredible surround sound effect
without compromising the quality of the audio stream. As video conferencing
technology and audio over the internet become mainstream, audio streaming
integrity will become very important. Your Bravo has the technology for
the future.
