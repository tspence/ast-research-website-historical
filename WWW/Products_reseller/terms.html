		<TD WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;<A NAME="edo"></A><B>EDO (Extended Data Output) RAM<BR>
<BR>
</B>A RAM specification that does not use error checking and instead relies on the dependability of modern memory
			devices. Because error checking is not used. EDO memory provides faster access than most other memory types.</TD>

			<P><A NAME="flashbios"></A><B>FlashBIOS (Basic Input/Output) System)</B></P>

			<P>RAM that retains data even when the computer is turned off. The BIOS resides in write-protected flash memory
			on EEPROM chips. The BIOS in flash memory can be changed with an electrical burst. Flash memory enables you to
			update the BIOS from a floppy disk or over a network.

			<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="hot_swap"></A><B>Hot swap</B></P>

			<P>A procedure that allows a failed component to be removed from the system and a replacement inserted into the
			system without powering down the computer. The AST Premium HS supports hot swapping of <A HREF="#SCSI" target="_top">SCSI</A>
			hard drives and power supply modules.

			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="isa"></A><B>Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)</B></P>

			<P>An open-architecture standard for I/O buses. ISA provides a 16-bit data path, maintaining compatibility with
			existing PC and AT-compatible add-in boards.

			<P><B>Minimum configuration</B></P>

			<P>A system that is minimally configured contains one microprocessor, one DIMM, no expansion boards of either type,
			one SCSI hard drive, the CD-ROM, and the 3.5&quot; floppy drive.

			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><A NAME="pci"></A><B>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</B></P>

			<P>A high performance, 32-bit I/O bus that provides compatibility with PCI expansion cards. PCI provides plug-and-play
			capability and operates at speeds up to 33 MHz.
		</TD>

	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH="100%">
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>Power-On Self Test (POST)</B></P>

			<P>The power-on self-test is a series of basic functional tests that are automatically run whenever the system
			is powered on or reset. POST does not provide extensive or configurable test options and performs basic troubleshooting.

		<TD WIDTH="100%">
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="SCSI"></A><B>Small-Computer Systems Interface (SCSI)</B></P>

			<P>An open-architecture standard for a class of intelligent peripherals, such as a disk, tape, and DAT drives,
			and CD-ROM devices, that share a common bus with a disk array controller (DAC). Each DAC can support up to 16 SCSI
			devices.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH="100%">
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><B>SCA-II (Single Connector Attachment)</B></P>

			<P>A standard for interfacing SCSI drives that combines power and data connections in the same connector. SCA-II
			specifies pin arrangements that connect signals in the order of ground, power, and data to ensure safe connections
			in the event of a hot swap.

		<TD WIDTH="100%">
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P><A NAME="sdram"></A><B>SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory)</B></P>

			<P>A RAM specification that uses synchronous communication to shorten data transfer timing. Synchronous communication
			eliminates much of the overhead by providing pre-specified timing, rendering much of the handshaking unnecessary.
			SDRAM includes error checking and correction to ensure data integrity.

			<P>USB is a new serial communication standard that allows up to 127 devices to be &quot;daisy-chained&quot; together
			on a single channel. USB was designed to simplify the connection of standard peripheral devices and to reduce the
			cost and resources necessary to support standard I/O functions.
