<I>Why Trade-In?</I><BR>
Today, approximately 60% of new computers are purchased to replace existing
computers. According to the Gartner Group, &quot;Companies that choose to
sell outdated equipment themselves often experience unexpected difficulty
and expense and without careful analysis of the activities required to dispose
of PCs, I.S. managers can put as much effort into disposal as acquisition.&quot;
It is estimated that the disposal of a PC could cost hundreds of dollars.</P>

<P><I>These costs include:</I></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Elimination of confidential or sensitive data and all
  software.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Storage expenses for obsolete equipment.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Accounting and administrative expenses to retire, sell
  or donate an asset.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Preparation for pre-sale or donation of PC as well as
  post-sale/donation support.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Risk of violation and non-compliance with EPA regulations
  for the disposal of hazardous materials.</FONT>
</UL>
