          The Network Group's mission is to
          provide additional value to your 
          purchase of AST computers by providing you with high quality service 
          before and after your purchase.  The value starts with our Account 
          Managers, who are thoroughly trained to help you select the AST 
          computer that will best meet your needs.  After the sale, The Network 
          Group can provide system configuration, on-site installation and 
          warranty repair services.  The Network Group is also a Microsoft 
          Solutions Provider and Novell Platinum Partner with the capability to 
          integrate your new AST computers into networked configurations with
