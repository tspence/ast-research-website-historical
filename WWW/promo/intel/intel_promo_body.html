Architecture</BIG></I></B></P>

<P><A HREF="../../Products/server/premium.html"><I>New AST Premium HS Server</I></A><I>
Reduces Cost of Ownership and Provides Peace of Mind</I></P>

<P>ATLANTA, Oct. 7, 1997 &#150; AST<SUP>&REG;</SUP> Computer, a leading
manufacturer of award-winning servers, desktops and mobile computers, today
announced here at Networld + Interop its newest mid-range server &#150;
the AST Premium HS Server &#150; combining the latest in high performance
and fault tolerance technology with a comprehensive service and support
program. Compact, affordable and easy to use, the new server supports I<SUB>2</SUB>O
technology. In fact, with the Premium HS Server shipping in late October,
AST is among the first manufacturer to deliver I<SUB>2</SUB>O-ready Ethernet
and SCSI RAID controllers as a standard feature in the base server.</P>

<P>&quot;AST is taking aggressive action in the server market. The Premium
HS Server platform includes leading-edge technology resulting in lower operational
risks, lower cost of ownership, and extended product life to adapt to the
needs of today&#146;s growing businesses,&quot; said Laura Raybin, AST&#146;s
director of Brand Marketing.</P>

<P>The Premium HS Server&#146;s controllers utilize two Intel i960<SUP><SMALL>&REG;</SUP></SMALL>
RD I/O processors (one for the Ethernet controller and smart PCI slots and
one for the SCSI RAID controller), to significantly reduce the I/O overhead
to the main CPUs, while increasing both Ethernet and hard disk throughput
as well as PCI slot acceleration for the future.</P>

<P>&quot;With AST being one of the earliest manufacturers of I<SUB>2</SUB>O-ready
drivers, its customers can take full advantage of the latest in performance
enhancement software as it becomes available,&quot; said Ron Smith, vice
president and general manager of Intel&#146;s Computing Enhancement Group.</P>

<P>Supporting the I<SUB>2</SUB>O architecture is only one way that AST is
addressing the need for higher- speed server platforms. High-speed 10,000
RPM drives increase overall data access by up to 30 percent, while AST&#146;s
patented, impedance-matching SCSI interfacing systems reduce signal noise,
increasing both reliability and data throughput.</P>

<P>To ensure optimal performance for its server customers, AST is addressing
high data availability in multiple ways: 1) Redundant component designs,
which include multiple hot-pluggable power supplies and RAID hard drives;
2) Rapid Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) with the Premium HS Server&#146;s highly
serviceable FlexChassis&trade; architecture simplifying maintenance and
upgrades; and 3) Proactive system-wide fault notification with AST&#146;s
comprehensive hardware management/monitoring software, which includes thermal
sensors, an easy-to-read LCD display, error logs, and chassis intrusion.
These features combined, create a highly robust platform with a complete
value greater than the individual parts.</P>

<P><B><I>Service and Support</I></B></P>

<P>AST stands behind its products with a standard three-year limited warranty

AST offers Guardian Care<SUP><SMALL>SM</SUP></SMALL>, an optional, highly

on-site response available 24 hours a day, every day of the year, in the
contiguous U.S. &#150; from specially trained technicians. Finally, to convey
a complete commitment to customers needs, AST&#146;s comprehensive sales,
marketing and technical staff is available for customer comments and questions.
AST believes that it is important to listen to the needs of a rapidly changing
industry.</P>

AST for computing solutions. This includes AST&#146;s web site, which offers
Web Support via email as well as answers to common technical questions,

<P>With estimated street prices starting at $7,349, the Premium HS Server
offers high value at an extremely low cost. Among the first servers available
with I<SUB>2</SUB>O-ready architecture, the Premium HS Server is scheduled
to be available in late October through AST-authorized resellers.</P>
